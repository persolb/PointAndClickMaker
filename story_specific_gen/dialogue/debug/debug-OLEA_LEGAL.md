# OLEA_LEGAL

- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N005_LEGAL_GREETING
  Office of Legacy Energy Assets, Legal. This line is recorded for quality and—more importantly—consistency. Name and assignment.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N007_LEGAL_SCOPE
  “Closure activities,” understood. Before we proceed: I can issue instruments. I cannot “authorize” conduct. Those are different verbs with different afterlives.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N020_AUTH_REBUKE
  I can’t give you “authorization to enter.” Not because you don’t have a key, and not because you shouldn’t be there. Because “authorize” implies we evaluated conditions we have not evaluated.
  What I can do is issue a Work Order describing a narrow task against a specific asset, for purposes of closure documentation. That is the shape of help I’m allowed to be.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N022_ALLOWED_SAY
  You are “on site for closure documentation.” You are not “investigating,” not “evaluating anomalous conditions,” and not “confirming safety.”
  Those phrases imply we had a safety baseline to compare against. We do not. We have a checklist and a funding deadline.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N023_COVERAGE
  I can provide an instrument that describes a narrow task against a specific asset. I cannot provide a blanket sentence that later reads like foreknowledge.
  If you want defensible coverage, you want boring specificity.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N030_WRITING
  A Work Order. A waiver. A memo that says “this communication exists.”
  Not a sentence that implies we predicted outcomes, endorsed conditions, or “authorized entry.” Those phrases turn a facility into a promise.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N040_WORKORDER_DIRECT
  Good. That’s a real noun. Work Orders attach to assets. Provide the asset ID.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N050_NEED_ASSET_ID
  I can. For that I need the asset identifier. Not the site nickname. Not the project acronym. The asset ID as it appears on the register.
  This is where people improvise and then we all spend six months pretending the improv was a clerical error.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N070_SP01_CONFIRM
  SP-zero-one. Thank you. That is an asset, not an argument.
  I will issue a Work Order for closure-support activities limited to verification and documentation steps as listed on the standard retirement checklist—no deviation, no exploratory language, and nothing that implies you’re there to “test” anything.
  It will be routed to the facility’s posted fax number.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N072_REFNUM
  Reference number: WO-RET-SP01. Put that in your notes. Do not put “authorized.” Put “Work Order issued for SP-01 closure documentation.”
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N073_SEND
  It will be sent. Do not describe this as “authorization.” Describe it as “Work Order issued for SP-01 closure documentation.”
  Goodbye.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N080_NO_ID
  Then I can’t issue anything. If I issue a Work Order to the wrong asset, you don’t get “coverage,” you get a discrepancy. Discrepancies breed questions.
  Find the plaque, the posted register, the asset tag—whatever the site still has that passes for identity—and call me back with the ID.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N090_LOOKUP_REFUSAL
  I’m not a registry service. And before you ask: yes, we have an Asset Register. No, I’m not going to read it into a recorded line and create a new record of what I “knew” when.
  You are onsite. The onsite label wins. Call back with the plaque text.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N100_PERSUADE_PASS
  I appreciate the creativity. I’m going to decline it. “Provisional” is not a legal state; it’s a mood.
  If you need immediate language, here is what you can say without making me a participant: “I am conducting site preservation and closure documentation pending issuance of a Work Order.”
  Call me back with the asset ID, and I issue the actual instrument.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N101_PERSUADE_FAIL
  No. If you need urgency, I can give you phrasing, not instruments. Instruments require identifiers.
  Call back with the ID. The system rewards specificity. It punishes speed.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N512_RADIO_LEGAL_1
  “Return” implies departure. Departure implies consent. Consent implies review. We did not— we are not on record—
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N514_RADIO_LEGAL_2
  Define it as “occupied for documentation.” Not “abandoned.” Not “left.” “Abandoned” is how you invite a third party to claim—
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N516_RADIO_LEGAL_3
  “By default” is not a chain of title. Also: stop saying “still.” “Still operating” implies we chose to keep it—
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_DEF_LEG1
  Define terms before you use them.
  And please don’t say “authorized” like it’s a blanket. A blanket is how you smother yourself.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_DEF_LEG2
  Title is fine. Titles are fiction we all agree to.
  Body text is where liability grows teeth.
  You are not “evaluating,” not “verifying safety,” not “confirming normalcy.” Those are comparative claims. We do not have a baseline we can prove existed.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_DEF_LEG3
  You are documenting the operational state for purposes of retirement processing, pursuant to the Evidence Packet, and any actions described are narrow-purpose and non-exploratory.
  Also remove “still.” If you write “still operating,” you imply intent. Intent implies governance. Governance implies duty.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_CLAUSE_ADD_LEG1
  That sentence will irritate everyone.
  Which is how you know it works.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_PRINT_LEG1
  Do not say “we authorized.”
  Say “this memo exists.” Existence is defensible.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_FRAMING
  This line is recorded, which I’m saying for your benefit, not mine.
  Define the act before you perform it. If you perform it first, it gets defined by whoever hates you most.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_DEFINITIONS
  You are executing a retirement sequence as a safety containment measure pursuant to the closure evidence packet.
  You are not “responding to an anomaly.”
  And do not say “still operating.” “Still” implies intent. Intent implies governance.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_REASON_PHRASE
  Use this exactly:
  “Initiating terminal shutdown per retirement checklist as risk-limiting containment; maintaining interlocks and continuous logging; operator present on-site.”
  It will irritate everyone. Which is how you know it’s narrow enough.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_ONE_SENTENCE
  And do not add a second sentence. Two sentences becomes a story.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_HOLD_LANGUAGE
  You will describe it as: “non-local compliance hold notice received; reference logged; shutdown executed per retirement checklist as risk-limiting containment with continuous logging.”
  No cause language. No motive language. Just receipt and procedure.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_EMERGENCY_LANGUAGE
  If you insist on this path, you will describe it as “risk-limiting interruption pending retirement processing.”
  Not “panic.” Not “reaction.” Words are adhesive.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_ACCEPTABLE_BETTER
  Acceptable. The first version is better.
  “Better” meaning: harder to misread later.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_LEGAL0
  Define the act before you perform it. If you perform it first, it gets defined by whoever hates you most.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ASKCAT_L
  “Demonstrated” meaning “asserted with attachments,” not “proven.” I’m saying that for the recording.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ASKAUTH_L
  Notice the verbs: “acknowledgment,” “acceptance.” Those are safer than “authorization,” and still operationally binding, which is a fun contradiction we will not discuss.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_SUBMIT_L
  And don’t say “authorize.” “Authorize” implies review. Review implies duty. Duty implies—well. Me.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_CATL_L
  We need the authority chain to say “acknowledge” and “accept,” not “grant.” “Grant” implies they owned it cleanly. They won’t thank you for that.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_CATT_L
  And they don’t imply we intended anything “ongoing.” Don’t say “keep it running.” Say “maintain continuity.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_REASON_GENERIC_L
  That’s one sentence. Keep it one sentence. Two sentences becomes a story.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_REASON_LEGACY_L
  Remove anything that implies novelty. “Legacy” is fine because it implies old paperwork, not new physics. And no “still.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_OPONLY_L
  I didn’t say you can’t. I’m saying you’ll be alone in the record. “Alone” is not illegal. It’s just expensive.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_PERSUADE_L
  They are not refusing you. They are refusing to be first in the chain. Give them the acknowledgment they can file.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ADDLEGAL_LEGALREAD
  OLEA Legal acknowledges submission for category update as a retirement processing instrument, limited purpose. Accepts the licensed relationship classification for SOL‑EARTH‑LOCAL under municipal legacy infrastructure service class. No admission of novelty. Continuous logging maintained. Operator present on-site.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_LEGAL_HELLO
  Office of Legacy Energy Assets, Legal. This line is recorded for consistency. Name and assignment.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_LEGAL_02
  Define “routing.”
  If you mean “creating a record that survives an audit,” say that.
  If you mean “moving liability somewhere it already belongs,” do not say that on a recorded line.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_LEGAL_03
  You get one sentence. Two becomes a story.
  Use: “This memo exists to document retirement processing communications and compliance hold handling for SOL‑EARTH‑LOCAL under municipal legacy infrastructure service class; continuous logging maintained; operator present on-site.”
  Do not add “still.” Do not add “because.”
  “Because” is how causality crawls into the margins.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_LEGAL_ACK
  Good. Those are nouns that already exist.
  Here is the acknowledgment, verb-limited:
  “OLEA Legal acknowledges submission for category update as a retirement processing instrument, limited purpose; accepts licensed relationship classification for SOL‑EARTH‑LOCAL under municipal legacy infrastructure service class; no admission of novelty; continuous logging maintained; operator present on-site.”
  Copy it exactly. If you paraphrase, you become the author.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_LEGAL_NOREF
  Then you do not have a chain, you have a feeling.
  You can still file the memo as “retirement processing communication,” but you cannot staple my voice to it.
  Find the notice reference string. Find the Work Order number. Call me back.
  The system rewards specificity. It punishes speed.
