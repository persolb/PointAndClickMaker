- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_COACH_INTERCEPT_1
  Don’t do that.
  Not because it’s forbidden—because it works and then you get attention you can’t file.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_COACH_INTERCEPT_3
  You need a token.
  Access is what tokens do. People just stand near doors and create delays.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_TOKEN_FOR_WHAT_2
  For everything that pretends it’s about safety.
  Doors, kiosks, window assignment—whether your questions count as “inquiry” or “interference.”
  Out here, you’re not a person until you have paperwork that says you’re permitted to occupy a line.
  That’s not philosophy. That’s how the intake software was purchased.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_WHATS_TER_2
  Transfer Entitlement Receipt.
  Receipt first, entitlement second—don’t ask me why. That’s Legal’s little lullaby.
  It’s the thing that says the system may treat your presence as accounted-for mass instead of unsolicited narrative.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_WHATS_TER_4
  You need to obtain a token that resolves to a TER when a door asks.
  If you ask for “access,” people start thinking about responsibility.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_PERSUADE_PASS_1
  I believe you.
  I still can’t route a mandate through a door reader.
  If you want this to stay quiet, you get filed first—then you do your work.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_PERSUADE_FAIL_1
  Don’t say that into the wrong space.
  Mandates trigger escalation loops because someone has to own them.
  Tokens don’t require ownership. That’s why they’re used.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_SHOW_OLEA_2
  Okay. That helps me help you, not the kiosk.
  Policy still holds. The kiosk doesn’t recognize employers. It recognizes artifacts.
  You can be right, or you can be filed.
  Being right doesn’t open doors.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_SHOW_OLEA_3
  Not “you.” Something attached to you.
  Something scannable. Something that can take an incident category without crying about it.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_CATEGORY_HINT_1
  Least-escalation phrasing: treat it like misrouted equipment transfer.
  Don’t lead with “authority,” don’t lead with “mandate,” and don’t argue with windows on the record.
  Get a token issued. Then you can be important somewhere that logs importance.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_USE_KIOSK_3
  It’s a shortcut.
  If it said the whole thing, you’d start negotiating with it, and then I have to log a “verbal incident.”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_FILE_AS_EQUIP_1
  Intake can file an object with a barcode and an incident category.
  If you can’t be listed, you get attached.
  You become—politely—“associated mass.”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_USE_DOOR_2
  Yeah.
  It won’t even reject you. Rejection implies you were an input.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_TOKENS_RUN_2
  Tokens run what can be audited.
  Doors, kiosks, windows—they answer artifacts. Not faces.
  If you want to move, you speak in tokens.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_THREATEN_2
  You can escalate.
  And then the escalation needs a category.
  And then you’re in the incident queue, waiting to be recognized as the kind of problem that’s allowed to exist.
  I’m not your enemy. I’m throughput.
  Let me keep you moving.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_GET_TOKEN_INFO_2
  Intake Hall. Windows 0/3/5/7/9.
  Pick the window that looks least interested in your life story.
  You file an incident category the system can accept.
  Then the system issues a token.
  Then the token becomes your voice. That’s the whole magic trick.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_GET_TOKEN_INFO_4
  Intake can’t file a person who isn’t listed in any jurisdiction.
  But Intake can file an object with a barcode and an incident category.
  You attach yourself to the object. You become—politely—“associated mass.”
  It’s not dehumanizing.
  It’s efficient. On paper.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_INTRO_2
  Before you pick a window—don’t improvise a story.
  Stories create responsibility. Categories create receipts.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_STANDING_1
  “Standing” is a legal word. Legal words bite.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_STANDING_2
  You want a Temporary Existence Receipt. That’s Window 0.
  Don’t say “I’m a person” and don’t say “I need access.”
  Say what can be filed. Then you can be difficult after you’re fileable.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_WRONG_1
  They’ll redirect you.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_WRONG_2
  Or they’ll log you as an interruption, if you insist on being specific.
  Worst case, you get an incident category you didn’t choose.
  You can be wrong, or you can be filed.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_OLEA_1
  Okay. That means you have an employer.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_OLEA_2
  It does not mean the windows have to care.
  If you want this quiet, go to Window 0 and let Intake pretend you’re cargo for five minutes.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_PERSUADE_PASS_1
  Fine.
  You want something the system already knows how to swallow: “misrouted equipment transfer.”
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_PERSUADE_PASS_2
  Keep it short. No biography. No motive.
  If you need to attach yourself, you’re “associated mass.”
  And you do not describe it.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_PERSUADE_FAIL_1
  The least-escalation wording is: less.
  Less detail. Less insistence. Less you.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_PERSUADE_FAIL_2
  Go to Window 0. Ask what categories are accepted.
  Don’t argue about the answer on the record.
