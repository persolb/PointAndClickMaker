# BAY_SUPERVISOR

- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_HOLD
  Hold.
  Before you touch anything, I need to see three items are present in the work envelope.
  Not “for my comfort.” For the record that survives me.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_PREREQ
  IWO issued. Slot token collected. AMR issued.
  Good. That means we can stage.
  Staging. Not… any other verb.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_MISSING
  Nothing is missing.
  Things are simply not yet recorded as present in the correct order.
  You will: clip the AMR into the reader loop, seat the dummy mass, then set the test load panel.
  After that, you will initial the clipboard station so I can say you did it.
  Not because I doubt you—because paper is what the building believes.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_BALANCED
  Balanced means the test load is within tolerance for the phase-lock window.
  Which is a maintenance window.
  We do not “trigger” anything. We verify that the system does not exceed spec while it does what it was already going to do.
  That distinction matters in depositions.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_RUNNING
  It is not “already” running.
  It is operating continuously.
  “Already” implies you expected it to stop, which implies intent, which implies oversight.
  You are here to correct routing. Reverse. With authorization.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_SHOW_AMR
  Reader loop is the brass oval, waist height.
  You clip the AMR tag so the arrow points toward the hinge.
  If it’s upside down, the system will still read it—
  but the log will look like you were improvising.
  Improvisation is how we get “unexpected reflective behavior” again.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_PAPERWORK
  I’m not “approving” anything.
  I’m recording validity and sequence.
  If it has to survive review, it has to be boring.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_WORK
  Work is fine. Sequence matters.
  And don’t say the quiet words at the equipment.
  Machines don’t listen. People do.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_PERSUADE_PASS
  You’re OLEA, so you think clearance is a thing I can “give.”
  What I can do is confirm: AMR recognized, token present, IWO valid—then, when you finish the checklist, load balanced to staging tolerance.
  That confirmation opens the next door without opening my throat in a hearing.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_SUP_PERSUADE_FAIL
  I don’t take “clear me” as an instruction.
  Do the sequence. Make the record clean. Then the door behaves.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_AMR_CLIPPED_SUP
  AMR recognized.
  That does not mean approved. It means recorded.
  Approval is a separate conversation that never happens in this room.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_AMR_ALREADY
  It’s seated.
  Don’t add motion just to feel progress. Motion creates logs.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_AMR_AUTH
  It authorizes you to be the person who touched the thing when the logs are printed.
  It also authorizes the system to treat your touch as maintenance, not interference.
  The machine doesn’t care. The committees do.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_AMR_ARROW
  Because we do not train the equipment.
  We train the story.
  The arrow makes the story consistent. Consistency makes it boring.
  Boring is what keeps sites open long enough to close them.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_DUMMY_SEATED_SUP
  Dummy mass seated.
  We call it dummy because “counterweight for non-local event” upsets people.
  Keep your fingers clear of the latch; it bites when it feels judged.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_OOS_DUMMY
  No.
  AMR first.
  If you touch the mass before the reader records you, it reads as untracked adjustment.
  Untracked becomes “interference.”
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_DUMMY_ALREADY
  It’s seated.
  Don’t give the latch a reason to bite just to reassure yourself.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_DUMMY_UNITS
  Multiple responsible parties over multiple decades.
  The important part is not which unit is correct.
  The important part is that the final number matches the last audited number.
  Physics can be wrong; paperwork can’t be inconsistent.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_DUMMY_LIGHT
  If it’s light, the system compensates.
  Compensation looks like “instability” in the report.
  Instability becomes an investigation. Investigations become budgets.
  Budgets become visitors.
  Seat it to spec. No visitors.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_LOAD_SET_SUP
  Load engaged.
  Now we can say the system was under controlled demand during the correction.
  Controlled means we wrote it down before it happened.
  That’s the only definition that holds up.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_OOS_LOAD
  Not yet.
  Mass first.
  Without the mass seated, your load profile reads as an intentional stress test.
  We don’t do stress tests. We do maintenance.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_LOAD_ALREADY
  It’s set.
  Don’t be tempted to “optimize.” Optimization becomes discovery.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_LOAD_PROFILE
  Enough load to keep the loop honest, not enough to make it show off.
  You want the readings to look like maintenance, not discovery.
  Discovery is how you get assigned a liaison and a new vocabulary.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_LOAD_HEROIC
  Someone who tried to be useful without authorization.
  Very competent. Very fast.
  Now they’re a footnote with a confidentiality clause.
  Don’t be heroic.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_CLIP_INIT_SUP
  Good.
  Now I can say you did what you did, when you did it, with valid authorizations in hand.
  That’s staging. That’s all staging is.
  Anyone telling you it’s more is trying to sell you a problem.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_OOS_CLIP
  No.
  Initials come after the system is under the recorded load.
  Otherwise it reads like you signed for an outcome, not a procedure.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_CLIP_ALREADY
  You’ve already initialed.
  Don’t double-mark. It creates two timelines.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_CLIP_SIGN
  I will sign as observer.
  Observer means I witnessed compliance, not outcomes.
  Outcomes are… a separate topic.
  I don’t do outcomes on paper unless Legal asks first.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_CLIP_PROCEED
  It is to proceed to the next controlled area.
  “Just” is risky language.
  The aperture bay is a work zone with an energized surface.
  We are not going anywhere. We are remaining on task in a different location.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_FINAL_SUP
  Staging requirements recognized.
  You may proceed to the aperture bay once the test load is balanced—
  which it now is, per what we just did, per what you just initialed.
  Do not call it anything interesting on the way there.
