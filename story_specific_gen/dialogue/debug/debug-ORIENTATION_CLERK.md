# ORIENTATION_CLERK

- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN3_2
  Orientation is for valid entrants.
  If you are here, you are either already valid, or not my problem, in the normal sense.
  If you need a TER, that is Intake. Window 0.
  Please do not become a discussion at this counter.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN3_DEFINE_1
  I cannot define it without assigning it.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN3_DEFINE_2
  Assigning it would be Intake. Window 0.
  This is not evasion. It is separation of functions.

  Orientation is a service window, yes. Not—just to be clear—not a promise of comprehension. It’s a distribution point. Paper only.
  
  Do you have an issued TER?
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / RULES_CLERK
  Happily. ‘Happily’ as in: it keeps me out of a meeting.
  
  Rule one: Remain within posted lanes. If a lane is unposted, assume it is posted elsewhere.
  Rule two: Do not interpret signage. Signage interprets you.
  Rule three: If you encounter an unnumbered door, you did not.
  Rule four: Any corridor marked SERVICE is not a corridor. It is a condition.
  
  There is an exception for the Map Kiosk routes, because the Map Kiosk is… technically… an official imagination.

  Depends what you’re trying to become on paper.
  
  Window 5 for Safety if you want hazard tags. Window 7 for Property if you want your belongings to have an opinion. Window 9 for Complaints if you want a record of your tone.
  
  If you need corridors and a map, there’s a Concourse Service Corridor access point. I’m not directing you there. I’m observing it exists.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / SHORTCUTS_CLERK
  No.
  
  We do not have shortcuts. Shortcuts imply the long way was optional, and the long way is where the cameras are calibrated.
  
  We do have… routing efficiencies. Historic. For congestion control. Not for speed.
  
  I can show you a pamphlet. The pamphlet is not a route. The pamphlet is a pamphlet.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / OLEA_CLERK
  Closure binder. Thank you. That’s a real noun. That’s something I can hand to.
  
  Orientation pamphlet, current revision. If it’s not current, it’s still the one we’re allowed to distribute.
  
  You’ll want the stamp for chain-of-custody. Not because anyone will ask. Because if they do ask, they will ask why it’s missing.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / GIVE_CLERK
  I can do that. I can absolutely do that.
  
  This is informational. If it contradicts posted signage, the signage is correct. If it contradicts itself, it’s a living document.
  
  Do not—and I’m saying this because people get creative—do not add your own annotations and then claim they were provided.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / TAKE_CLERK
  I did not see a sketch.
  
  Ink happens. Ink is not policy.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / LEAVE_CLERK
  Remember: if you feel turned around, you are. That is not an emergency unless you write it down as one.
