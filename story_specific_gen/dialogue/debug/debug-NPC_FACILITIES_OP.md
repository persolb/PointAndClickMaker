  Amber is not “purging.”
  Amber is “purge state indicated.” There is a difference.
  One is a verb. One is a liability.

  It can be airflow. It can be sensor health. It can be the system refusing to commit to a claim.
  Which, frankly, I respect.
  Also, if you pressed the test button, that’s fine, but you’ve now created a tamper event.
  Not a safety event. A tamper event. Those are tracked more aggressively.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_FACILITIES_CLEAR
  I can’t “clear” reality. I can request a status refresh.
  But the refresh is inhibited by the access interlock, because the system assumes only trained personnel request refreshes.
  Don’t ask me why it assumes that; I didn’t raise it.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_FACILITIES_PASS
  Fine. I’ll file the refresh request as “status verification pending access inhibit.”
  If anyone asks: you did not ask me to bypass anything. You asked me to document.
  No ticket number over the phone. The system will generate it in Records view.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_FACILITIES_FAIL
  No. If I create a paper trail that implies action, it becomes action.
  Document your constraint. That’s the only safe verb here.

  I own the ventilation readings the same way a thermometer owns a fever.
