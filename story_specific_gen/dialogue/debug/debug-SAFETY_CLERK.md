# SAFETY_CLERK

- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN5_2
  Safety handles incidents.
  “Incident” means a recorded deviation, not a feeling.
  If you need a TER, you need Intake to record you first.
  Window 0. Please do not workshop wording here.

  Escalation is also an incident.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN5_THREAT_2
  I can’t open an escalation without a category.
  You do not want me choosing your category.
  Go to Intake. Window 0. Quietly.
