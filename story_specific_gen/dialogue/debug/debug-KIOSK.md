  Select contact to append to closure packet:
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_WELCOME
  Welcome.
  This station files presence for staffing minimums.
  It does not grant access. It does not deny access. It files.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_MENU_HEADER
  Select an action:
  1) Scan Contractor Badge
  2) Enter Supervisor Extension
  3) View Presence Filing Policy (Excerpt)
  4) File Presence / Print Receipt
  5) Cancel
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_EXPLAIN_REQUIREMENTS
  Filing requires corroboration and supervision.
  Corroboration: a badge artifact scan or a vendor-issued surrogate artifact.
  Supervision: an on-file numeric extension.
  You may still stand here.
  You simply will not be filed as doing so.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_BADGE_INSTR_PASS
  Place badge on reader. Do not “swipe.”
  Swiping implies motion. Motion implies intent.
  Intent requires an on-file individual.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_BADGE_INSTR_FAIL
  No badge artifact detected.
  If you do not possess an artifact, you may not scan an artifact.
  This is not a denial. It is a categorization.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_EXT_ACCEPT
  Supervisor extension accepted.
  Field length: 4 digits. Leading zeroes preserved.
  Supervision is now wrong in a consistent way.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_EXT_REJECT_ZERO
  Supervisor extension rejected.
  Field length: 4 digits. Leading zeroes must be preserved.
  Failure to preserve zeroes will be recorded as failure to preserve supervision.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_EXT_REJECT_NAME
  Supervisor extension is numeric.
  Names are not accepted. Names are disputable.
  Extensions are merely wrong in a consistent way.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_POLICY
  Presence Filing Policy (Excerpt):
  - Presence must be corroborated by a badge artifact or a vendor-issued surrogate artifact.
  - Presence must be supervised by an on-file extension.
  - Presence receipts are valid “in the normal sense,” excluding: metaphoric, narrative, and retrospective senses.
  This excerpt is provided for convenience and does not constitute guidance.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_WHY_CARE
  I do not care.
  “Care” implies discretion.
  I maintain a minimum staffing count so the facility can truthfully state it is not unattended, which is distinct from stating it is safe.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_OLEA_RESPONSE
  Your citation has been received.
  Citations do not populate fields.
  Fields are populated by artifacts and extensions.
  This clarification is provided for convenience and does not constitute guidance.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_FILE_PASS
  Filing requires:
  A) Badge artifact scan: PASS
  B) Supervisor extension: PASS
  Proceeding to Temporary Presence Receipt issuance.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_TPR_DISCLAIMER
  Temporary Presence Receipt (TPR) will be issued.
  This is not an admission of employment.
  It is an admission of paperwork.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / K_KEEP_VISIBLE
  Please keep the receipt visible.
  Visibility reduces disputes. Disputes increase interviews.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N3_KIOSK_GREETING
  OVERFLOW INTAKE — BARCODE INQUIRY.
  Scan item. Do not narrate the scan. Narration complicates accountability.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_LOOK_K1
  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1) Present barcode.
  2) Maintain a neutral facial expression. This is for camera consistency.
  3) Accept assigned routing. Do not self-route. Self-routing creates parallel truth.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_ASKM_K1
  UNALLOCATED MASS: mass with no confirmed custody endpoint.
  Not “missing.” Missing implies a search obligation. This is a routing condition.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_ASKM_K2
  Examples include:
  — Items that failed to arrive.
  — Items that arrived without arriving properly.
  — Items whose documentation arrived alone, which is preferable.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_ASKM_K3
  If you are feeling blamed: that is a separate service window.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_ASKA_K1
  Because you are presenting a RETURN LABEL.
  Returns require an original INTAKE EVENT.
  No intake event is recorded for this item at this facility.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_ASKA_K2
  Therefore, the system must assume the item did not arrive.
  This is not suspicion. This is database hygiene.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_ASKA_K3
  If the item is physically present elsewhere, please do not confirm that here.
  That would create a competing narrative.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_PERS_K1
  Acknowledged: OLEA-associated presence.
  Closure activities are categorized as “high sensitivity” and “low flexibility.”
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_PERS_K2
  Manual override is available only to:
  — Intake Supervisor (present)
  — Incident Clerk (unpanicked)
  — Authority Having Jurisdiction (undefined)
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_PERS_K3
  You may request an override by taking a number.
  Numbers are issued after routing is assigned.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_PERS_K4
  This is for your protection.
  If I override, I become involved. I am not staffed to be involved.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_K1
  BEEP.
  Barcode read: VALID.
  Item status: NOT PRESENT. Thank you for your honesty.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_K2
  Routing condition detected: FAILED ARRIVAL.
  Generating paperwork to account for the portion of reality that did not cooperate.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_K3
  ROUTING SLIP ISSUED: UNALLOCATED MASS.
  Do not fold. Folding implies completion.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_K4
  Next step: Proceed to Incident Queue Stanchions.
  If approached by staff, do not summarize. Present slip. Summaries create liability.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N003_KIOSK_GREETING
  TER AUTHORIZATION: PRESENT.
  REQUEST TYPE: ROUTE ARTIFACT.
  Note: A “map” is not a route artifact. Please don’t say “map.” It complicates retention.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N020_LOOK
  INTERFACE STATUS: OPERATIONAL.
  PRINTER STATUS: READY.
  RATIONS COUNTER: ACTIVE—don’t look at me like that, it was installed after “overprinting.”
  Tamper seal: intact. Which is my way of saying I am not the one improvising.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N030_RESTRICT
  Restrictions are not punitive. They are preventative.
  If you hold a complete facility representation, you can claim you were “trying to go somewhere.”
  And then everyone has to discuss where “somewhere” is, and whether you were authorized to exist there.
  
  TER establishes permissible corridors of presence.
  Printing outside those corridors is a conversion from “presence” to “premeditation.”
  Which becomes… discoverable.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N040_VALIDATE
  Place badge on validator.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N041_VALIDATE_RESULT
  BADGE: OLEA FIELD SYSTEMS SPECIALIST.
  CREDENTIAL: VALID.
  Liability posture: ACCEPTABLE. Not “safe.” We don’t output “safe.”
  
  TER linkage confirmed.
  If you are about to say “So print the whole thing,” don’t.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N050_LOOP
  The service-route reader loop provides a compliant circulation pattern.
  It returns you to a place you can be documented leaving from.
  People find that reassuring. The building does too, allegedly.
  
  Warning: The loop is not optimized for arrival. It is optimized for audit.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N060_REQUEST
  Define route scope.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N080_FULL_NOTAVAIL
  “Full facility” is a claim.
  Claims create obligations. Obligations create interviews.
  Also, there is no single “full” representation. There are versions, and they disagree in writing.
  
  Choose a scope that can survive a records request.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N081_USEFUL_INVALID
  Scope rejected.
  “Useful” is not a bounded category. It is a confession.
  Select a scope with corridor limits.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N070_TER_INFO
  Concourse and service corridors.
  It will look incomplete because it is incomplete. That is the point.
  If you need something else, you need a different TER, and then you need a different you.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N071_TER_GATED_ACCEPT
  Accepted. That phrasing is… appropriately narrow.
  Generating output as a route artifact, not as “knowledge.” Thank you.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N073_PRINTING
  Printing.
  Do not remove paper until the cut. People get confident and then we have a tearing incident, and somehow it’s my fault.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N075_OUTPUT
  OUTPUT: MAP FRAGMENT 1 — CONCOURSE + SERVICE CORRIDORS.
  Classification: operational support. Not navigational.
  If you navigate with it, that’s between you and your conscience, not me.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N090_CANCEL
  Canceled.
  For the record, I didn’t refuse you. You declined to proceed. This distinction matters later.
