# INTAKE_CLERK

- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_INTRO_2
  Intake.
  State your filing category.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_TER_1
  A TER is an output, not an input.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_TER_2
  We do not issue existence. We issue a receipt acknowledging a recordable condition, in the normal sense.
  If you are not listed in a jurisdiction, you cannot be filed as a person.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_TER_3
  If you can present a barcoded object, we can file the object.
  Additional mass may be marked “associated,” without comment.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_CATS_1
  The acceptable categories are those currently accepted.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_CATS_2
  I understand that sounds circular. It prevents negotiation.
  “Misrouted equipment transfer” is usually non-escalatory.
  “Unclaimed attachment” is also available, but tends to invite questions, in the normal sense.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_OLEA_1
  Employer credentials are not a category.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_OLEA_2
  They are… context. Context is not scannable.
  If you want a TER, you will proceed through Intake as recordable mass.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_BARGAIN_1
  Simplicity is appreciated.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_BARGAIN_2
  Speed is not promised. Speed implies discretion.
  We provide sequence. Sequence produces receipts.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COMMIT_2
  Correct.
  In the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_CLERK_OPEN_1
  Intake. State your filing category.
  Present the unallocated slip, if you intend to be processed in sequence—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_PRESENT_SLIP_2
  Thank you. That is a document.
  It does not establish personhood. It establishes unresolved mass. The distinction is important for blame—in the normal sense.
  State your filing category.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_CATS_2
  The categories currently accepted are those that do not trigger review.
  I understand that sounds interpretive. It is not. It is how Intake remains Intake—in the normal sense.
  “Misrouted equipment transfer” is typically non-escalatory.
  “Nonhazardous backfeed residue” is currently available, pending wording.
  “Unclaimed attachment” is available, but invites questions. Questions become incidents.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_PROPERTY_2
  Property requires a claimant. A claimant requires a fileable entity.
  You are—at present—an accounting condition with shoes.
  Intake is how the building agrees to pretend you are something else—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_OLEA_2
  Employer credentials are context. Context is not scannable.
  If you require recognition, you will obtain it by becoming recordable mass first.
  Then you may be important somewhere that logs importance—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_PERSUADE_PASS_1
  Use “misrouted equipment transfer.”
  If you require attachment language, write “associated mass (do not describe).”
  Do not add adjectives. Adjectives are how people smuggle liability—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_PERSUADE_FAIL_1
  I cannot endorse phrasing beyond the categories currently accepted.
  Negotiation creates incidents.
  State your filing category—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_BARGAIN_2
  Simplicity reduces narrative. That helps.
  A receipt is an output, not an input.
  State your filing category.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_PROCEED_2
  Correct. In sequence—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_FORM_SLIDE_2
  For unallocated mass, you will file an associated object.
  Additional mass may be marked “associated.”
  You will not describe the additional mass. That is not a moral stance. It is a throughput stance.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_NEED_OBJECT_2
  You need something the system can recognize without having to believe it.
  Barcodes. Serial numbers. Categories.
  Belief is for Orientation. This is Intake—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_PICK_WRONG_2
  You will be redirected.
  Or you will be held in review. Review is not punitive. Review is simply longer than you are comfortable admitting.
  Choose a category the building already knows how to forget.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_BADGE_1
  A temporary badge is an artifact indicating an active receipt.
  It does not confer authority. It reduces questions—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_BADGE_2
  It will print a category code and a validity window.
  If you are looking for your name: that is not offered here.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_TOOLBAG_2
  Toolbag. Category?
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_TOOLBAG_4
  Good. Objects with serials have somewhere to go.
  “Associated mass” will be recorded without description.
  That is protective language. For both of us—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_RESIDUE_2
  “Residue” implies remainder after a process.
  I am not asking you to describe the process. I am clarifying the word—in the normal sense.
  Persistent is acceptable. Nonhazardous is acceptable.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_RESIDUE_3
  You will be treated as a condition the building is permitted to ignore safely.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_THIS_WEEK_2
  “This week” is not an official interval.
  But yes, categories drift. We receive bulletins. We comply.
  Use “misrouted equipment transfer.”
  If you require attachment language, write “associated mass (do not describe).”
  Do not add adjectives—in the normal sense.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_COACHED_1
  Accepted.
  You have chosen a category that will not inspire curiosity. That is wise here.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_INTRO_2
  Property. Claims.
  A claim requires a claimant, in the normal sense. You have—sufficient filing to be inconvenient today.
  State the property basis. Do not state the narrative.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_STUB_OFFER_1
  You can have a stub.
  A stub is a placeholder for a future argument. It is not an argument by itself.
  Identify the item class you intend to claim.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_CLASS_EQUIP_1
  "Issued equipment" is a class. It is not proof.
  "Service kit" implies a function, which implies a handler, which implies responsibility.
  I will record it as: Service kit; serialized if available; claimant present; entitlement pending verification.
  Do not correct my phrasing on the record.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_CLASS_DOCS_1
  "Facility documentation" is not property. It is a liability with staples.
  Which means, yes, it is often treated as property.
  I can issue a stub for: Records packet, unindexed; claimant present; disposition pending verification.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_WHY_WORDING_1
  Because "ownership" is a word with friends.
  Friends arrive. Friends bring paperwork.
  "Pending" prevents me from promising anything, in the normal sense.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_VERIFICATION_1
  Serials. Assignment logs. Chain-of-custody notes. Incident recovery records.
  Verification is later, and preferably elsewhere.
  Here, we create a paper object that can survive a building pretending you weren't here.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_PRINT_STUB_2
  Property Claim Stub issued. Processed, in the normal sense.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_CLASSES_ACCEPTABLE_1
  Acceptable classes are the ones that do not make me choose intent.
  "Issued equipment." "Personal effects," if you enjoy disputes.
  "Records packet," if you prefer a different dispute.
  If you say "mine," I will hear "hearing."
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_STUB_DOES_1
  The stub does three things.
  One: It timestamps that you were present and asserted a future claim.
  Two: It prevents someone else from asserting you were not present, in the normal sense.
  Three: It gives you something to lose, which improves behavior. The last part is unofficial.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_ACCESS_NOT_PROPERTY_1
  Access is not a property function.
  Access is a safety function pretending to be a door.
  I issue stubs.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_BASIS_1
  A "property basis" is the reason you get to argue without being removed.
  Serial numbers. Assignment logs. Incident recoveries. Sometimes just persistence.
  A basis is not a story. Stories invite counter-stories.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_BASIS_TO_STUB_1
  I can issue a stub.
  It will not say you own anything. It will say you intend to claim something, pending proof that the thing is ownable.
  The distinction is comforting to auditors.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_TER_NOT_ENOUGH_1
  The TER is proof you have been filed as a condition the building can tolerate.
  It is not proof you have rights. "Rights" is a different window. Possibly a different building.
  If you would like a document that implies less, I can help you.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_STUB_IMPLIES_1
  The stub implies you will return.
  Which is not a prediction. It is a filing posture.
  Shall I prepare it?
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_ESCALATE_1
  Escalation is an incident category.
  If you want an incident category attached to your file, in the normal sense—keep talking.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_ESCALATE_WISE_1
  Wise.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_OLEA_1
  OLEA credentials are context. Context is not a claim basis.
  Context can, however, increase how carefully I word the denial later.
  If you want something useful, request a stub.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_OLEA_NO_CLASS_1
  There is no "OLEA class." There are items, and there are claimants, and there are disputes.
  I avoid disputes as a hobby, in the normal sense.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_PERSUADE_PASS_1
  Minimal detail is acceptable.
  But you will still select an item class, because blank fields attract attention.
  Proceed.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_PERSUADE_FAIL_1
  No.
  Minimal detail is how disputes are smuggled into tidy boxes.
  State the class, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_CLERK_OPEN_1
  Complaints.
  If you are here to be heard, that is not offered.
  If you are here to be processed, present the paper—then stop adding meaning to it, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_STAMP_FAST_1
  Good. That is a request for ink, not justice.
  “Processed” means it entered a queue.
  “No action” means it exited the queue without changing the world.
  People find that upsetting. Which is… common.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_STAMP_FAST_2
  Place the form flat. Do not hold it while I stamp it.
  Holding implies transfer. Transfer implies consent, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_STAMP_FAST_4
  Processed. No action.
  Keep it visible if you need a conversation to end.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_NO_ACTION_1
  It means the office has achieved closure without achieving change.
  We did something to the paper so we don’t have to do something to the building.
  That is the service, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_NO_ACTION_2
  If you want “action,” you want Safety.
  Safety will ask you to define the problem. Defining creates responsibility.
  Here, you get a stamp and a clean exit.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_JUST_RECEIPT_1
  “Just” is doing a lot of work there.
  It’s a receipt that prevents someone from demanding a better receipt later.
  Which is the closest thing we have to relief, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_INCIDENT_1
  Not if you behave.
  “Incident” is a word with routing. Routing is a word with meetings.
  Complaints are a cul-de-sac by design, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_INCIDENT_2
  If you describe harm, hazard, intent, or blame, someone will reclassify it for you.
  Then yes, it becomes an incident.
  Do you want a stamp, or do you want a category?
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_NO_DESC_STAMP_1
  Perfect. That is how you keep your file small.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_SAFEST_LINE_1
  Safest is blank. Blank is also suspicious.
  Write: “Service dissatisfaction.”
  Do not specify the service. Specifying creates a service obligation, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_OLEA_1
  Credentials are context. Context is flammable.
  If you are important, be important somewhere that logs importance.
  Here, we log complaints. Which is not the same as solving anything, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_OLEA_2
  Do you want the stamp or do you want a conversation that can be quoted?
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_PERSUADE_PASS_1
  Fine. You want language that implies nothing and still travels.
  “Processed, no action” is the headline.
  Under it: “Acknowledged without admission.”
  Do not add dates you can’t prove. Dates invite calendars. Calendars invite auditors, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_PERSUADE_PASS_STAMP_1
  I did not advise you. I repeated an available phrase, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_PERSUADE_FAIL_1
  No.
  I do not help draft language. Drafting implies authorship. Authorship implies intent.
  Choose the stamp as provided, or leave with your thoughts intact, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_ESCALATE_1
  Escalation is a category. Categories create receipts.
  If you want a receipt that follows you, keep going.
  Or you can take “Processed, no action” and make your problem someone else’s silence, in the normal sense.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_ESCALATE_WISE_1
  Wise.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_STAMP_CONFIRM_1
  Placed flat. No narrative. Thank you.
