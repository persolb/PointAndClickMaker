  Guard Shack vestibule line is active.
  If this is about the dispenser: yes, it is stocked.
  “Expired” is a materials designation, not— I’m not saying ignore it. I’m saying don’t make it an access conversation.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_ACCEPT_1
  The kiosk evaluates presence of an insert.
  It does not evaluate your feelings about the date.
  The date is for issuance governance, which is a separate workflow, owned by a separate— look, I’m not the date.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_PRESENCE_1
  I did not say “not current.”
  I said “presence.”
  Currentness implies a schedule. Schedules imply staffing. Staffing implies we’re open.
  We are not open.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_OWNER_1
  Issuance governance is owned by Admin Services, historically.
  Historically is doing work in that sentence.
  If you need a name, you can file a request for custodian attribution. It will return “unassigned,” which is technically an answer.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_WHY_1
  Because disposal creates a record, and records create questions.
  Also because the last time someone “cleaned up,” they cleaned up the wrong thing and we had to un-clean it.
  So now we do “stabilization,” which is like cleaning, but less actionable.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_PERSUADE_PASS_1
  Okay— okay. “Passes audit” is a phrase that makes everyone behave.
  The kiosk checks: insert present, name entered, time stamp generated. That’s it.
  The insert date is not validated at the kiosk. It is validated during issuance, which is not happening here, because— and I’m saying this carefully— there is no issuer on-site.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_PERSUADE_PASS_2
  Take one insert. Don’t take a handful. A handful looks like intent.
  And if someone later asks why it’s expired, you say: “Stock provided on-site.” That’s a location statement. It’s not a decision statement.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_PERSUADE_FAIL_1
  I can’t advise bypassing issuance governance.
  If the dispenser is stocked, it is stocked.
  If a workflow rejects, you should submit a workflow exception request through the kiosk help panel— if it’s online.
  If it’s not online, then it’s not rejecting anything, is it.
