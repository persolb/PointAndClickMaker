  If you’re calling to ask who put a lock on: I don’t answer “who.”
  I answer “under what work authorization,” which is safer for everyone involved, including you.

  Several. Potentially overlapping. That’s not an error. That’s layered protection.
  The blank tag—before you say it—might not be blank. Ink fades. Responsibility does not.
  And no, you cannot remove any lock that is not yours.
  Even if the person is retired, relocated, or… administratively unavailable.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_SAFETY_NEED
  You need to document that you cannot proceed.
  Different need. Better outcome.
  Put your personal lock on when you get to that step, verify zero energy state per procedure, and do not interpret silence as permission.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_SAFETY_REF
  Write this down: you’re looking for the lock-tree log tied to the hasp reference on the secondary tag.
  If you quote me, I will deny I gave it to you and then point you to the placard that already did.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CONTACT_SAFETY
  “Owns” is a dangerous verb. I “maintain oversight.”
  Oversight does not include removing locks, authorizing entry, or being present when things go wrong.
