# Story

## 1. Core Premise

Earth built a Vacuum Energy Stabilizer—a rotating, three-axis inertial machine designed to draw baseline power from fluctuations in empty space.  
It was commissioned and operated by a municipal-scale authority: public funding, public oversight, public paperwork.

- **Normal mode:** continuous rotation, power generation only
- **Latent mode:** rare alignment state causes the central containment sphere to phase-lock
- **Result:** the sphere stops behaving like matter and starts behaving like _addressable surface_

They called it S.P.I.N.D.L.E. — Spatial Power Inertial Node for Distributed Load Equalization

It's not clearly documented, but someone was erased with no body. Even a single ambiguous personnel record would clarify this.

No one recognized this as a transit mechanism. The 1980s incident was classified as:

- structural instability
- personnel error
- “unexpected reflective behavior” (actual phrase in the report)

The facility was mothballed, not decommissioned. The machine was left intact because it still supplied minimal baseline power to the grid.


## 2. Tone and Genre
Tone:

- Dry, procedural humor
- The player is competent, surrounded by institutional failure

Style:

- Offices: 1970s style offices
- Facility: Everything is built like infrastructure back-of-house: ducts, service corridors, intake windows, signage, numbered queues, pneumatic tubes

Characters have vivid personalities.

Let NPCs talk like people protecting themselves mid-sentence.

> “The incident was caused by unexpected reflective behavior.  
> Which is not a reflection.  
> Legally.”

Let NPCs react intensely to trivial issues and mildly to severe ones.

Do not make NPCs incompetent in their core skill.

Do not undercut the player’s competence.

#### Procedural Text Rhythm

For every block of purely procedural text:

- insert one emotional tell
- or one self-protective clarification
- or one irrelevant fixation

Not all three. Just one.

#### Shorten Player Responses, Lengthen NPC Responses

The player is concise + NPCs over-explain defensively

Player option:

> “Why is it still running?”

NPC response:

> “It is not still running.  
> It is running continuously.  
> ‘Still’ implies intent.”

## 3. Narrative Rules (Story Physics)

### Visual / Mechanical Identity

- Three independent rotating frames with mismatched maintenance markings
- Central sphere:
  - In normal operation: dull, matte, over-insulated
  - In alignment: smooth, mirror-like, reflects _impossible angles_
- No glyphs, no symbols, no readable alien logic
- All control labels are human, wrong, and inconsistent

### Mechanics (Operational Framing)

Mechanics:

- load demand - you reroute breakers, bring subsystems online, start test loads
- staffing level - you call people in, trick security into “present,” spoof a sign-in.
- compliance state - you file forms, fix signage, place inspection tags
- paperwork completeness - you assemble a binder; missing pages block actions.

### Act II Constraint

Core Constraint

You can travel only as far as your paperwork says you are allowed to exist.

## 4. World Background

The facility was mothballed, not decommissioned. The machine was left intact because it still supplied minimal baseline power to the grid.

The 1980s incident was poorly documented. No one recognized the “unexpected reflective behavior” as a transit mechanism.

### Act III Reveal Context

Earth is not generating power. It is drawing from a cross-jurisdictional infrastructure network owned by The Metastable Transfer Authority (MTA).

The Vacuum Energy Stabilizer is:

- a misclassified transfer node. MTA calls it N.O.D.E. - Networked Oscillatory Distribution Engine
- owned, indirectly, by the Metastable Transfer Authority (MTA)
- actually has nothing to do with vacuum energy
- operating far outside its licensed purpose

Evidence:

- billing ledgers
- maintenance schedules from elsewhere
- audit flags that predate the 1980s incident

The “accident” was a compliance enforcement event.

Include a room full of generic 'non-local compliance' notices. These will be revealed to be from the MTA in act 3, but player ignores in Act 1.

## 5. Player Role
Now the player is an engineer going back to properly close down the site due to budget reasons, and finds how it actually works.

The player’s contract includes a completion bonus tied to formal closure before a fiscal cutoff.

The decommissioning checklist requires: verification of operational status, confirmation of load characteristics, and execution of the **official** shutdown sequence.

## 6. Factions and Power Structure
### Office of Legacy Energy Assets (OLEA)

A municipal pseudo-government authority, which gets funding from Department of Energy.  
The player's employer.

#### Mandate and Public Face

The OLEA is a mid-level municipal authority chartered to manage, maintain, and retire large-scale energy infrastructure whose original operators no longer exist.

Publicly, OLEA presents itself as fiscally responsible, safety-focused, technically conservative, and allergic to surprises.

Its mission statements stress _stability_, _continuity_, and _risk minimization_. None mention discovery, optimization, or innovation.

#### Actual Operating Reality

OLEA exists at the intersection of three incompatible pressures:

1. Policy: “No Surprises” - OLEA policy treats novel behavior as failure, even if beneficial. Investigation is only authorized to support closure, not explanation. This policy exists because OLEA inherited facilities after accidents, scandals, or bankruptcies. The agency was built to absorb embarrassment, not insight.
2. Funding: “Operational Until Proven Otherwise” - OLEA’s budget is justified by: megawatts delivered, liabilities retired, and audits passed. Investigating an anomaly converts a _maintenance line item_ into a _research expense_, which OLEA is not funded to defend.
3. Reputation: “Competent Stewards of Other People’s Mistakes” - OLEA’s institutional reputation depends on being seen as methodical, boring, and correct. If OLEA is seen as _finding new science_ in old plants, it risks becoming a target for: political oversight,  academic scrutiny, and jurisdictional interference. None of these come with funding.

> “The site was always mundane, always understood, and always handled correctly.”

#### Internal Contradictions in Practice

These pressures manifest as everyday absurdities:

- **Compliance officers** demand exhaustive documentation while discouraging new findings.
- **Budget analysts** argue to keep the machine running while advocating for closure.
- **Safety reviewers** flag anomalies but downgrade their severity to avoid escalation.
- **Legal staff** insist nothing unprecedented has occurred, while drafting contingency language for exactly that.

#### Relationship to the Player

OLEA assigns the player because:

- they are senior enough to sign off
- junior enough to absorb blame
- external enough to be isolated if necessary

### External Assurance Contractor (EAC)

**Type:** Third-party audit and compliance services firm  
**Status:** Contracted by OLEA’s funders, not by OLEA itself  
**Authority:** None operational, none technical, limited rhetorical leverage

The EAC believes its role is to verify that OLEA is “following best practices”, document “process adherence”, and flag deviations from industry norms. They do not understand that OLEA’s mandate is retire without learning. They assume curiosity is implicit. It is not.

The EAC has minimal power. They cannot issue orders,  cannot stop work, cannot approve shutdown, and cannot interpret the machine. But they can: request documentation mid-task, schedule interviews during critical operations, reframe anomalies as “open questions”, and generate audit artifacts that persist after they leave.

Representative Character: Senior Assurance Liaison  
Fixation: “Comparability”  
Returns constantly to:

> “We just need to know what this is comparable to.”

Behavioral pattern:

- Asks technically literate questions with the wrong framing
- Assumes every anomaly implies a missing appendix
- Treats uncertainty as a documentation failure, not a physical one

Example dialogue:

> “I’m not saying it _is_ a portal.  
> I’m saying if it were, we’d need to know which framework applies.  
> Because if there’s no framework, we can’t close the finding.”

Act I presence only. They leave before the reveal.

### The Metastable Transfer Authority (MTA)

Not villains.

- Exists to move things nobody wants to think about:
  - excess energy
  - trash
  - waste heat
  - surplus reality
- Operates on inter-domain agreements older than current governments
- Treats Earth as a delinquent endpoint - the ticket to troubleshoot was only put higher in the queue due to the player's actions
- Massively bureaucratic - not malicious, but not competent for anything outside policy. Procedurally brittle.
- Never even considered using N.O.D.E. for anything else, like exploration or travel. Maybe they consider it similar to 'Star-trek teleporter actually kills users and makes a new person.' They would never put anything they care about in there. don't directly compare to Star-Trek.

People on the Act II world sometimes refer to them as the Authority or that upstream group.


## 7. Act Structure

### Act I - Temporarily Closed (Since 1987)

**Objective:** Enter a facility that was never truly closed, to formally close the site.

The player’s contract includes a completion bonus tied to formal closure before a fiscal cutoff.

The decommissioning checklist requires: verification of operational status, confirmation of load characteristics, and execution of the **official** shutdown sequence.

NPC logic reinforces this:

- Legal insists: “Legally, it is still running. Physically is a different department.”
- Engineering insists: “We never authorized a cold shutdown.”
- Records insists: “The last verified state was ‘operational.’”

Obstacles:

- Deferred maintenance layers
- Security procedures that contradict each other
- Contractors who still think they own parts of the site
- Power systems that refuse to start unless something unrelated is “temporarily” fixed

Mechanics:

- load demand - you reroute breakers, bring subsystems online, start test loads
- staffing level - you call people in, trick security into “present,” spoof a sign-in.
- compliance state - you file forms, fix signage, place inspection tags
- paperwork completeness - you assemble a binder; missing pages block actions.

Tone:

- Dry, procedural humor
- The player is competent, surrounded by institutional failure

Style:

- Offices: 1970s style offices
- Facility: Everything is built like infrastructure back-of-house: ducts, service corridors, intake windows, signage, numbered queues, pneumatic tubes

Include a room full of generic 'non-local compliance' notices. These will be revealed to be from the MTA in act 3, but player ignores in Act 1.

Give the player an early “Aha” moment: send a small object through and get it back with a return label.

**Reveal**:

The moment the player starts shutdown verification, while standing next to the device, the power grid requests load shedding. The device responds by re-entering alignment:

- the containment sphere phase-locks
- local inertial reference breaks
- the player is classified as attached mass and is sent to a new world

### Act II - Everything Is Working Normally

**Objective:** Get back to earth to finish the shutdown

The player still has radio contact with Earth when near the exit location, but it fades quick. They don't know how to get back.

Radio fragments from Earth (fading, partial):

- Legal discussing whether absence counts as abandonment
- Budget freezing the completion bonus
- Someone asking if the player’s tools are now “foreign assets”

The player realizes:

- if the shutdown completes without them, they become the incident
- if it never completes, they become the liability anchor
- the only way to clear their status is to be present at formal closure

Destination feel:

- Adjacent to Earth - still human
- Civilized but incompatible. The place works, but no one can legally acknowledge you exist. The player is repeatedly redirected to “intake.”
- Governed by rules that resemble policy, not alien culture

Nobody at the destination mentions Earth, the MTA, OLEA, or SPINDLE... since they don't know what any of those are.

Nobody at the destination calls what happened travel. Everyone calls it

- overflow
- backfeed
- routing error
- player is already listed as “attached mass” elsewhere : "You’re already in a system. Just not this one."

Structure Act II as three escalating wins, not endless deferrals:

1. Get recognized as a thing (Temporary Existence Receipt).
2. Get recognized as owned by someone (Attached Mass Registry entry).
3. Get recognized as eligible to transit (Interconnection Work Order / Clearance).

Each “redirect” should drop something useful: a stamp, a badge, a form, a map fragment, a tool.

In early Act II, the MTA is hinted at but not mentioned. Any mention to MTA is just:

- “upstream authority”
- “external routing entity”
- “non-local infrastructure”
- “legacy interconnection partner”

Late in Act II, the MTA is mentioned without explanation.

Player gets back to Earth facility.

### Act III - Pending Compliance

**Reveal:**

Earth is not generating power. It is drawing from a cross-jurisdictional infrastructure network owned by The Metastable Transfer Authority (MTA). A reveal like a letter outside the device:

> “NOTICE: Unauthorized load detected.  
> Origin Node: SOL-EARTH-LOCAL  
> Managing Authority: METASTABLE TRANSFER AUTHORITY (MTA)”

Nobody on Earth knows what that means. 'Are they another contractor?'

The player isn't able to close the device, as it's being held open by the other side. In addition to not getting a bonus, their 'employment record is about to be closed as the cause of the incident.'

The Vacuum Energy Stabilizer is:

- a misclassified transfer node. MTA calls it N.O.D.E. - Networked Oscillatory Distribution Engine
- owned, indirectly, by the Metastable Transfer Authority (MTA)
- actually has nothing to do with vacuum energy
- operating far outside its licensed purpose

Evidence:

- billing ledgers
- maintenance schedules from elsewhere
- audit flags that predate the 1980s incident

The “accident” was a compliance enforcement event.

### Endgame Choices (Expandable)

- Shut the device down and collapse the routes
- Renegotiate Earth’s classification
- Hide the alignment function inside acceptable tolerances
- Redirect liability to another department

## 8. Key Story Beats
### Characters

Assign each recurring NPC a phrase, concern, or fixation they return to even when irrelevant.

Examples:

- Compliance officer: repeats variations of _“in the normal sense”_
- Facilities manager: obsessed with warranty coverage
- Contractor: keeps clarifying _“that’s not in my scope”_

### Dialog

Let NPCs talk like people protecting themselves mid-sentence.

> “The incident was caused by unexpected reflective behavior.  
> Which is not a reflection.  
> Legally.”

### Act I Walkthrough (Outline)

Gain lawful access, assemble the closure binder, run the “official” shutdown verification, observe the latent alignment behavior, and trigger the routing event into Act II.

#### Core Loop (Act I)
Progress is gated by four interacting states:
- **Load demand:** you route breakers, bring subsystems online, start test loads
- **Staffing level:** you create “presence” via sign-in artifacts and remote procedures
- **Compliance state:** you resolve contradictions, tag hazards, satisfy procedural requirements
- **Paperwork completeness:** you assemble a binder; missing pages block actions


0) Cold Open and Tutorial Beat (Approach Road)

Location
Approach road, main gate, fence line, car trunk / equipment case.

Player learns
- Hotspots and navigation in a Monkey-Island-like click language
- Facility is “closed” but still powering something

Actions
- **Open trunk / equipment case** and collect starter kit:
  - hardhat, safety glasses, multimeter
  - roll of “TEMPORARY” labels
  - a single blank inspection tag
  - a cheap label maker (low battery)
  - clipboard titled: **“Closure Package – SPINDLE Site (Draft)”**
- **Try the gate keypad**
  - It logs the attempt and prints a tiny receipt:
    - “ACCESS ATTEMPT RECORDED”
    - “REQUEST ROUTED TO RECORDS”
- **Notice conflicting signs**
  - Sign 1: “SITE DECOMMISSIONED – NO ENTRY”
  - Sign 2: “SITE OPERATIONAL – AUTHORIZED STAFF ONLY”
  - Add binder to-do: **Resolve signage conflict**

State effects
- Paperwork completeness: +1 (you now have the binder shell)
- Compliance state: flagged (sign conflict logged)

---

1) Get “Permission” to Enter (Without Anyone Being Present)

Location
Guard shack exterior and vestibule.

Key idea
The facility treats “presence” as a paperwork condition, not a physical fact.

Actions
- **Guard shack door**: locked; card reader present; power indicator dim
- **Call box** connects to an offsite security vendor
  - They cannot verify you, but they can verify you are **scheduled** if you appear in the system
  - They advise: “Have Records mark you ‘onsite.’”
- Find a **pneumatic tube station label**:
  - “RECORDS ↔ SECURITY ↔ OPERATIONS” (dead, but labeled)
- Obtain a **Visitor Badge Insert** (expired stock in a wall dispenser)

State effects
- Paperwork completeness: +1 (badge insert acquired)

---

2) Bring Up Minimal Power (Wake the Building)

Location
Exterior service corridor / utility alcove / meter room.

Tone beat
The building is alive in the way a copier is alive.

Actions
- Locate a live auxiliary panel feeding minimal loads
- **Breaker label puzzle**
  - Labels do not match across eras (1981 vs 1996 stickers)
- Use multimeter to identify a safe outlet circuit
- **Charge the label maker** enough to print a few tags
- Power the guard shack reader (via correct auxiliary breaker)

Result
Card reader wakes and requests:
- “ACTIVE BADGE + TRAINING DATE”
It prints a slip:
- “Training date required. Consult Records.”

State effects
- Load demand: +1 (aux loads)
- Paperwork completeness: +1 (reader slip becomes binder page)

---

3) Records Without Records (Create a Paper Trail From Scraps)

Location
Admin wing entry, lobby, Records door.

Key idea
You cannot open Records until Records authorizes entry, but Records is a locked room.

Actions
- Access admin wing (powered strike or mechanical override hidden behind a plate)
- Lobby kiosk boots to limited menu:
  - “VISITOR REGISTRATION”
  - “INCIDENT ARCHIVE (RESTRICTED)”
  - “TRAINING VERIFICATION”
  - All demand an employee ID
- Find wall-mounted phone list with outdated extensions
- Call OLEA **Legal** via the only number that still routes
  - Legal will not “authorize entry”
  - Legal can issue a **Work Order** if you provide the correct asset ID
- Obtain asset ID from a faded plaque:
  - “S.P.I.N.D.L.E. NODE: SP-01 / Commissioned 1979”
  - Partially covered by contractor stickers

Deliverable setup
- Legal sends the work order to a dead fax number printed on the wall
- Fax machine is in a locked supply closet

Puzzle resolution
- Find a facilities log book referencing:
  - “KEYS IN FIRE PANEL PER SOP”
- Fire panel contains a small key ring labeled “TEMPORARY”

State effects
- Paperwork completeness: +2 (asset ID recorded; key ring acquired)

---

4) Binder Gate: Build the Minimum Closure Package

Location
Admin office, fax room, copy room.

Minimum binder sections (Act I)
- Work Order (Legal)
- Site Access Log
- Training Verification (or waiver)
- Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) plan
- Operational Status Verification checklist (this triggers the act ending)

Actions
- Unlock supply closet; load fax paper/toner
- Receive the work order (fax arrives fragmented; re-run pages)
- Copy room puzzle: copier demands a service code
  - Code sticker is covered by a newer sticker
- Use label maker to print a “TEMPORARY LIFT” tag and peel the top sticker “legally”
- Assemble binder physically:
  - clip pages, create tabs, insert placeholders

Humor beat
Copier prints footer: “UNCONTROLLED WHEN PRINTED.”

State effects
- Paperwork completeness reaches threshold that enables Ops access attempts

---

5) Make Yourself “Present” (Staffing Level Puzzle)

Location
Lobby kiosk + security desk nook.

Key idea
System accepts sign-in if it receives any plausible identifier plus a supervisor reference.

Actions
- Kiosk needs a scannable magnetic badge
- Find an old contractor badge in a drawer (demagnetized or unreadable)
- Restore “just enough” magnetism using a small magnet/speaker part from a desk object
- Supervisor field accepts an extension, not a name
  - Use Legal’s extension from phone list
- System prints:
  - **Temporary Presence Receipt (TPR)** + disclaimer

Result
Security vendor now sees you as “onsite (provisionally)” and remotely unlocks guard shack interior door.

State effects
- Staffing level: +1 (you now count as present “in the normal sense”)
- Paperwork completeness: +1 (TPR added to binder)

---

6) Meet the EAC Liaison (Act I Only)

Location
Conference room or admin hallway.

Purpose
- Provide audit pressure and the “comparability” fixation
- Generate a small blocker: an open finding that must be satisfied or bypassed

Interaction
EAC issues a **Finding Slip** that blocks final sign-off unless you attach one of:
- the 1987 incident page
- a waiver signed by someone with authority (Legal)
- a “no-anomaly observed” test printout from Operations

State effects
- Paperwork completeness is constrained until you resolve/bypass the finding

---

7) Operations Wing: Contradictory Procedures as Puzzle Loop

Location
Operations corridor, control room door, mechanical gallery viewing window.

Core loop
Three barriers; each solved via a different “bureaucratic skill.”

Barrier A: Door interlock wants a Training Date
Solutions:
- Find a training waiver template; fax to Legal; receive signed waiver
- Or locate expired training sticker sheet; apply to badge insert as a token

Barrier B: LOTO requires tags you do not have
Solutions:
- Use the single blank inspection tag for the main lock point
- Print “temporary tags” for subpoints with the label maker

Barrier C: System refuses to start unless an unrelated subsystem is healthy
Example:
- A ventilation damper must report “OPEN”
Fix:
- Simple competent mechanical action in a duct access panel

State effects
- Compliance state: +2 (you are now “doing it right,” procedurally)
- Load demand: +1 (more subsystems online)

---

8) Early Aha: Send a Small Object Through, Get It Back Labeled

Location
SPINDLE chamber observation area / adjacent test bay.

Trigger condition
Run Operational Status Verification: “Confirm containment sphere surface condition under nominal load.”

Actions
- Start nominal spin (three-axis frames rotate; mismatched maintenance marks)
- Sphere is dull/matte in normal mode
- Perform a sanctioned “reflectivity test” using a calibration puck
- A brief alignment flicker occurs during a demand adjustment or test load
- Puck vanishes on contact with mirror-like surface
- A pneumatic tube canister clunks into a nearby tray

Returned label (key artifact)
- “MISROUTED ITEM – RETURN TO ORIGIN NODE”
- Barcode + routing stamp you do not recognize

NPC reactions
- EAC: “That is not a reflection. Legally.”
- Facilities (phone): “Is that under warranty?”

State effects
- Paperwork completeness: major artifact obtained
- Compliance state: now at risk (you have evidence of something new)

---

9) The “Official” Shutdown Verification That Causes Routing (Act End)

Location
Control room + SPINDLE chamber.

Setup
The “shutdown sequence” is actually a verification sequence that induces alignment during load-shedding conditions.

Actions
- Record baseline load characteristics (instrumentation task)
- Grid requests load shedding (alarm/radio)
- Procedure demands stability during demand events prior to shutdown authorization
- Player reroutes breakers to satisfy both instructions by redefining “noncritical” loads
- Alignment begins; frames lock into rare geometry
- Sphere phase-locks into mirror state

Point of no return
Final step requires a physical witness at the device:
- You must be standing near it
- System classifies you as attached mass

Act ending
Local inertial reference breaks; sphere behaves like an addressable surface.  
You are routed to Act II.

---

Act I Completion Checklist
Act I completes when the player has:
- Entered the facility with a provisional presence receipt
- Built the Minimum Closure Package binder (with tabs and artifacts)
- Gained Operations access and brought key subsystems online
- Triggered and documented “unexpected reflective behavior”
- Initiated shutdown verification during a demand event
- Been routed to the first destination (Act II)

---

Key Items Introduced in Act I
- Closure Package binder shell (with tabs)
- Gate keypad receipt (“request routed to Records”)
- Visitor badge insert (expired)
- Card reader “training date required” slip
- Asset ID (SP-01) from faded plaque
- Key ring labeled “TEMPORARY”
- Work Order (Legal) via fax
- Temporary Presence Receipt (TPR)
- Training waiver or training token sticker
- LOTO tags (1 real tag + printed temporary tags)
- SPINDLE verification printout showing transient alignment
- Returned pneumatic tube canister + “misrouted item” label
- EAC Finding Slip (resolved or bypassed)

---

Act I NPC Hooks (Fixations)
- Legal (OLEA): definition control (“‘Still’ implies intent.”)
- Security vendor: procedural helplessness (“I can’t confirm you are authorized, but I can confirm you are scheduled.”)
- Facilities manager: warranty fixation
- Contractor voicemail: scope fixation (“That’s not in my scope.”)
- EAC liaison (Act I only): comparability fixation (“Which framework applies?”)

### Act II Walkthrough (Outline)

Goal
Return to Earth long enough to be physically present for formal site closure.

Core Constraint
You can travel only as far as your paperwork says you are allowed to exist.

The Three Wins (Act II Backbone)
1. **Be recognized as a thing** → **Temporary Existence Receipt (TER)**
2. **Be recognized as owned** → **Attached Mass Registry (AMR) entry**
3. **Be recognized as eligible to transit** → **Interconnection Work Order (IWO) / Clearance**

Each redirect should drop at least one useful artifact:
- stamp
- badge
- form
- map fragment
- scope-limited tool

---

0) Arrival: Overflow Intake Concourse

Location
A clean municipal-industrial concourse around a service bay that contains the local mirror-surface aperture (your “exit location”).

What the player learns (fast)
- Doors and kiosks respond to **tokens**, not people.
- The system treats you as **misrouted material**, not a visitor.
- Radio works only near the bay; it fades quickly.

Interactions
- Scan the Act I return barcode (canister label) at a kiosk.
- Kiosk prints: “UNALLOCATED MASS (ATTACHED). NEXT STEP: INTAKE (WINDOW 0).”

Artifact
- **Routing Slip: Unallocated Mass** (blocks many doors until TER is obtained)

---

1) Win 1 — Temporary Existence Receipt (TER)

1A) Intake Window 0: Get processed as a “thing”
**Obstacle:** Clerk cannot file a person not present in any jurisdiction list.  
They *can* file an object with a barcode and an incident category.

Intake packet fields you must satisfy
- Origin node (you have it, but do not know it is acceptable yet)
- Material category (cannot choose “human”)
- Handling instructions (must be something the building can follow)

Solutions (pick one main path)
- **Path A (engineering): Register your toolbag first**
  - Register tools by serial number and category.
  - File yourself as **attached accessory mass** to the registered kit.
- **Path B (bureaucratic): File as backfeed residue**
  - Find a “Misrouted Cargo / Backfeed” template in a forms rack.
  - File yourself as **Backfeed residue (persistent, nonhazardous)**.
- **Path C (social): Use a Process Coach hint**
  - A competent “process coach” NPC tells you which categories clerks accept this week.
  - You still do the filing; they just remove guesswork.

Output
- **Temporary Existence Receipt (TER)** (paper + barcode)
- **Temporary badge sleeve / badge** (neutral color)

TER unlocks
- Standard doors
- Map kiosk
- Noncritical service corridors

TER does not unlock
- Interconnection bay
- Scheduling systems
- Ownership functions

Artifacts gained
- **TER**
- **Temporary badge**
- **Map Fragment 1:** Concourse / service corridors / intake rails

---

2) Productive Redirect Loop (Short Runaround That Pays Out)

Purpose
Teach that stamps are currency here, while giving items that solve later gates.

Redirects (each gives something useful)
- **Window 3: Orientation**
  - Artifact: rules pamphlet with a corridor shortcut sketched on the back
- **Window 5: Safety**
  - Artifact: glove tag that also acts as a service-route token
- **Window 7: Property**
  - Artifact: Property Claim Stub (needed for ownership logic)
- **Window 9: Complaints**
  - Artifact: Complaint stamp (“Processed, no action”) usable as a substitute stamp later

Running pattern
Clerks over-explain a simple rule, then defend their wording when it sounds like it implies travel.

---

3) Win 2 — Attached Mass Registry (AMR) Entry

3A) The ownership problem
With TER you “exist,” but you are not assigned.  
You cannot be routed until the system knows who is responsible for you.

AMR requirement
An owner-of-record attached to your mass entry. “Owner” can be:
- a department
- a contract
- a legacy agreement
- a maintenance queue

3B) Find a sponsor that can legally “own” you
**Obstacle:** Nobody wants liability for unknown attached mass that talks.

Key locations
- **Legacy Interconnections Archive** (library-like, hostile to curiosity)
- **Property Title Counter**
- **Interconnection Maintenance Triage** (competent techs, strict scope)

Core steps
1. Use TER to reach the **Legacy Interconnections Archive**.
2. Scan your canister barcode to pull legacy entries.
3. Discover older metadata such as:
   - “Endpoint: SOL-EARTH-LOCAL (delinquent)”
   - “Managing authority: upstream / external” (not named yet)
4. Use this framing at Triage:
   - You are not “new.” You are a **maintenance issue** tied to an existing endpoint.

AMR gate (choose one main hurdle)
- **Hurdle: Sponsor signature required**
  - Triage sponsors only if you present an “acceptable failure mode.”
  - Combine:
    - misrouted-item label (Act I artifact)
    - proof of persistence (you are still present)
    - toolbag registration (you have structured inventory)
- **Hurdle: Ownership of personal effects**
  - They refuse to sponsor “you,” but will sponsor your kit.
  - Register PPE + tools as a single unit; file yourself as attached mass to the kit.

Output
- **AMR entry** (registry printout + physical clip/tag)

Artifacts gained
- **AMR tag**
- **AMR registry printout**
- **Map Fragment 2:** Archive / triage / interconnection access points
- **Tool (scope-limited):** barcode probe or seal punch (single-purpose)

---

4) Win 3 — Interconnection Work Order (IWO) / Transit Clearance

4A) Scheduling is an asset
**Obstacle:** Time slots are owned. You do not get one by asking.

IWO requirements
- Work classification (maintenance, not travel)
- Slot token (time asset)
- Clearance chain (commonly three stamps)

4B) Acquire a slot without a friendly sponsor
Common solutions
- **No-show recovery**
  - A slot exists for “mass that failed to arrive.”
  - Claim it using TER + AMR: you arrived, just not where expected.
- **Policy substitution**
  - One stamp is unobtainable in practice.
  - Use the Complaint stamp (“Processed, no action”) as a policy-compliant substitute.
- **Trade-up**
  - Exchange earlier stamps/badges for a slot token from a clerk who values “completeness.”

Late-act hint (single line, no explanation)
A clerk mutters:
- “MTA will reject this if your node isn’t in good standing.”

Output
- **Interconnection Work Order (IWO) / Clearance packet**
- Route classification is described as **reverse routing correction** (never called travel).

Artifacts gained
- **IWO**
- **Clearance packet**
- **Slot token** (stamped chit)
- **Map Fragment 3:** Interconnection bay / staging / return rail

---

5) Return Sequence: Staging as Attached Mass

Location
Interconnection bay behind intake.

Gate condition
The bay accepts only:
- valid slot token
- AMR tag
- active IWO

Short mechanical puzzle (engineering-forward)
- Clip AMR tag into a reader loop (physical interface)
- Balance a test load (dummy mass fixture or resistor bank)
- Trigger a controlled phase-lock event under supervision of a tech who refuses the word “travel”

Radio beat (only near the aperture)
Fading Earth fragments, heard briefly:
- Legal debating whether absence counts as abandonment
- Budget freezing the completion bonus
- Someone asking if the player’s tools are now “foreign assets”

Act II endpoint
The mirror-surface condition appears.
You are routed back to the Earth facility.

---

Key Items Introduced in Act II
- Temporary Existence Receipt (TER)
- Temporary badge sleeve / badge
- Toolbag registration record
- Property Claim Stub
- Attached Mass Registry (AMR) tag + printout
- Slot token (time asset)
- Interconnection Work Order (IWO) / Clearance packet
- Map Fragments 1–3
- Scope-limited tool (barcode probe or seal punch)

---

Act II NPC Set (with fixations)
- **Intake Clerk:** repeats variations of “in the normal sense”
- **Process Coach:** “You can be wrong, or you can be filed.”
- **Archive Tech:** obsessed with indexing rules; treats curiosity as misfiling
- **Triage Maintainer:** warranty/scope language; technically competent
- **Scheduling Clerk:** treats time slots as property with moral weight
- **Bay Supervisor:** insists on “reverse routing correction,” never “return”

### Act III Walkthrough (Outline)

Goal
Complete a lawful closure *without* becoming the incident, while the device is being held open by an upstream authority.

Core Constraint
Earth’s “generator” is an unlicensed interconnection node. The upstream side can keep the alignment state active and can treat any action as a compliance event.

Act III Backbone (Four Gates)
- **Gate A — Reality:** Prove the upstream authority is real and has standing (evidence, not theory).
- **Gate B — Time:** Buy a temporary operating window (a pause in enforcement).
- **Gate C — Authority:** Get a closure path recognized as valid (by OLEA, the utility, and upstream).
- **Gate D — Choice:** Execute one of the endgame paths with a clean paper trail.

0) Return to Earth: “Still Open”

Location
SPINDLE chamber + control room + admin wing.

Immediate state
- The containment sphere is in (or flickering into) mirror state.
- Local alarms call it “reflective behavior,” “instability,” or “test anomaly,” depending on which panel you read.

First tasks (fast)
- Re-enter the facility as a logged presence (you cannot let the building decide you are “missing” again).
- Stabilize the room:
  - restore a safe perimeter
  - set ventilation / interlocks to a stable mode
  - start a baseline log printer (paper is your protection)

Artifact
- **Time-stamped presence proof** (badge log / control-room printout / camera still)

---

1) The Reveal Delivery: MTA Notice

Trigger
A document appears at the site in a way that looks mundane:
- printed on a legacy dot-matrix printer
- ejected from a pneumatic tube
- taped to a panel with a “service” clip

Document (key item)
**NOTICE: Unauthorized load detected**  
- Origin Node: **SOL-EARTH-LOCAL**  
- Managing Authority: **METASTABLE TRANSFER AUTHORITY (MTA)**  
- Action: “Hold state pending compliance.”

Immediate objective
Stop OLEA from treating this as “just a contractor letter” long enough for you to assemble proof.

NPC reactions (tone and stakes)
- Legal: argues over definitions (“notice” vs “finding” vs “invoice”).
- Facilities: asks whether the hold state is “covered.”
- Utility rep (phone): cares only about grid stability and liability.

Artifact
- **MTA Notice** (physical, with barcodes and a reference number)

---

2) Gate A — Evidence Packet: Prove Standing

Objective
Build an **Evidence Packet** that makes “MTA is real” the least controversial statement in the room.

Required evidence types (collect 3–5)
- **Billing ledgers** showing recurring charges to SOL-EARTH-LOCAL
- **Maintenance schedules** not authored by any Earth entity
- **Audit flags** that predate the 1980s incident
- **Interconnection terms** (license language, service class, endpoint category)
- **Matching identifiers** between Act II artifacts and Earth paperwork
  - barcode formats
  - stamp shapes
  - routing phrases (“backfeed,” “overflow,” “reverse routing correction”)

Puzzle set (pick a few, keep them crisp)
- **Records is locked again**
  - You gain access by presenting your own time-stamped presence proof plus the MTA Notice reference number.
- **Microfilm / archive puzzle**
  - Find a working reader and a missing reel.
  - The missing reel is mislabeled under “VACUUM / PUBLIC OUTREACH.”
- **Sticker archaeology**
  - Contractor stickers on plaques conceal older asset IDs that match MTA identifiers.
- **Non-local compliance notices room**
  - The “generic notices” from Act I are revealed as MTA-origin forms.
  - One contains a legacy routing map key that matches your Act II map fragments.

Output (deliverable)
- **Evidence Packet (binder section)** with a cover sheet:
  - “Standing indicators”
  - “Identifiers match”
  - “Charges and schedules”
  - “Pre-incident dates”

---

3) Gate B — Buy Time: Temporary Operating Window

Objective
Prevent an immediate enforcement action while you decide how to proceed.

Mechanic
MTA is holding the node open. You need a **temporary operating variance** that MTA accepts as “in queue.”

Player actions
- Locate the correct form language among the non-local notices:
  - “Temporary operating variance”
  - “Stabilization period”
  - “Incident containment”
- Submit it using a channel the machine still supports:
  - pneumatic tube address
  - a printer-coded cover sheet that the device treats as a routed packet
  - a barcode-scan sequence at the sphere when it is mirror-like (treated as “addressable surface”)

Puzzle
The variance requires a classification you do not have:
- You obtain it by reclassifying SPINDLE from “generator” to “node under corrective maintenance” inside your own closure binder.
- The act is bureaucratic, not physical: change the document set so the building behaves differently.

Output
- **Variance Acknowledgment** (a stamped slip or automated printout)
- A short hold period begins (measured as “processing time,” not hours)

---

4) Gate C — Closure Authority: Align Three Parties

Objective
Create a closure path that is valid for:
- OLEA sign-off
- utility grid constraints
- MTA compliance mechanics

Key scene: “Closure Meeting That Is Not a Meeting”
Same room, same people, different fixations:
- Legal: wants a narrative that limits exposure
- Budget: wants the bonus deadline to disappear
- Utility: wants the lights to stay on
- You: want a closure that does not assign you as cause

Player tasks (paper-first)
- Add a new binder section: **Interconnection Compliance Response**
- Generate two controlled artifacts:
  - **Chain-of-custody** for every new document
  - **Witness statement** that pins the timeline to your logged presence

Mechanical task (short, engineering-forward)
Prepare a “safe idle” state that is defensible:
- keep the node stable
- cap the risk of uncontrolled alignment
- keep logs running

Output
- **Authorized Closure Path Memo** (internal) that references MTA notice numbers and your Evidence Packet

---

5) Endgame Paths (Branching)

Each path has:
- a physical action set (in the chamber / control room)
- a paperwork action set (binder sections and signatures)
- a risk trade (grid stability vs compliance vs your personal exposure)

Path 1 — Shut Down and Collapse Routes
Goal
Force a terminal shutdown and break the interconnection.

Gating requirements
- A load-shedding plan that keeps the utility from blaming you
- A documented justification that frames it as safety containment

Key puzzles
- **Upstream hold**
  - You must physically interrupt the alignment lock mechanism (servo, sensor loop, or interlock bypass) while keeping logs.
- **LOTO escalation**
  - New lock points appear when the node is “held open.”
  - You must tag them in a way Legal accepts.

Outcome
- Routes collapse (future travel becomes harder or impossible).
- OLEA gets a closure, MTA flags it as an unauthorized termination.

---

Path 2 — Renegotiate Earth’s Classification
Goal
Convert Earth from “delinquent endpoint” to a licensed node.

Gating requirements
- Evidence Packet strong enough to support standing
- A payment or settlement mechanism (can be absurd, still procedural)

Key puzzles
- **Arrears and service class**
  - You find a service class that Earth can plausibly claim (legacy municipal infrastructure).
- **Signature authority**
  - OLEA cannot sign, but can “acknowledge.”
  - Utility can “accept,” which MTA treats as standing.

Outcome
- Node remains operational under a new classification.
- Travel becomes possible as a regulated function (future expansions fit naturally).

---

Path 3 — Hide Alignment Inside Tolerances
Goal
Keep the device “generating” while preventing alignment except under controlled conditions.

Gating requirements
- A defensible instrumentation calibration story
- A compliance narrative that calls alignment a measurement artifact

Key puzzles
- **Sensor truth vs paper truth**
  - You adjust calibration to keep mirror-state entry below threshold.
- **Audit survivability**
  - You update preventive maintenance and test logs so an auditor sees a stable, boring machine.

Outcome
- Earth keeps the benefit.
- The portal function exists, but only through deliberate, player-driven actions.

---

Path 4 — Redirect Liability (Institutional Judo)
Goal
Move “cause” onto a party that can absorb it without harming you.

Gating requirements
- A clean chain-of-custody
- A plausible responsible entity (contractor, inherited authority, legacy agreement)

Key puzzles
- **Contract archaeology**
  - Find a surviving contract clause that assigns responsibility for “interconnection behavior.”
- **Scope trap**
  - A contractor NPC is competent, but boxed in by their own scope language.
  - You use that language to attach liability to their warranty chain.

Outcome
- Your record clears.
- Closure outcome varies based on which entity takes the hit.

---

6) Act III Completion Checklist

- Secured time-stamped proof of presence on return
- Obtained and preserved the MTA Notice
- Built an Evidence Packet that supports standing
- Filed a temporary operating variance (or created an equivalent hold)

- Variance Acknowledgment slip (processing hold)
- Interconnection Compliance Response section
- Authorized Closure Path Memo
- Endgame-specific artifacts:
  - terminal shutdown justification

---

Act III NPC Set (Fixations)
- **OLEA Legal:** definition control and exposure limits
- **OLEA Budget:** deadline manipulation and cost framing
- **Utility Dispatcher/Engineer:** grid stability, load-shed documentation
- **Facilities Manager:** warranty and “covered work” boundaries
- **MTA Contact (indirect or brief physical presence):** queue position, service class, standing indicators
- **Records Clerk:** “I can file this, or I can understand it. Pick one.”

## 9. Player Choice and Consequences

### Act I: Four Interacting States (Core Loop)

Progress is gated by four interacting states:

- **Load demand:** you route breakers, bring subsystems online, start test loads
- **Staffing level:** you create “presence” via sign-in artifacts and remote procedures
- **Compliance state:** you resolve contradictions, tag hazards, satisfy procedural requirements
- **Paperwork completeness:** you assemble a binder; missing pages block actions

### Act II: Three Escalating Wins

Structure Act II as three escalating wins, not endless deferrals:

1. Get recognized as a thing (Temporary Existence Receipt).
2. Get recognized as owned by someone (Attached Mass Registry entry).
3. Get recognized as eligible to transit (Interconnection Work Order / Clearance).

Each “redirect” should drop something useful: a stamp, a badge, a form, a map fragment, a tool.

### Act III: Branching Endgame Paths

Endgame Choices (Expandable)

- Shut the device down and collapse the routes
- Renegotiate Earth’s classification
- Hide the alignment function inside acceptable tolerances
- Redirect liability to another department


## 10. Endgame States
Endgame Choices (Expandable)

- Shut the device down and collapse the routes
- Renegotiate Earth’s classification
- Hide the alignment function inside acceptable tolerances
- Redirect liability to another department

(Endgame paths are detailed in Act III Walkthrough (Outline): “Endgame Paths (Branching)”.)

## 11. Themes
- Dry, procedural humor
- The player is competent, surrounded by institutional failure

### Act II
- Governed by rules that resemble policy, not alien culture
- Exists to move things nobody wants to think about:
  - excess energy
  - trash
  - waste heat
  - surplus reality


## 12. Canon vs Flexibility
### Canon

- Three independent rotating frames with mismatched maintenance markings
- Central sphere:
  - In normal operation: dull, matte, over-insulated
  - In alignment: smooth, mirror-like, reflects _impossible angles_
- No glyphs, no symbols, no readable alien logic
- All control labels are human, wrong, and inconsistent
- Not clearly documented, but someone was erased with no body
- The 1980s incident was classified as:
  - structural instability
  - personnel error
  - “unexpected reflective behavior” (actual phrase in the report)
- The facility was mothballed, not decommissioned
- MTA is not villains
- Nobody calls what happened travel; it is “overflow,” “backfeed,” “routing error”

## 13. Inspirations and Non-Goals
### Inspirations

- SPINDLE looks like the three axis spinning portal from the movie Contact mixed with the gravity core from the movie Event Horizon.
- Hotspots and navigation in a Monkey-Island-like click language

### Non-Goals

- No glyphs, no symbols, no readable alien logic
- Do not make NPCs incompetent in their core skill
- Do not undercut the player’s competence
- MTA: Not villains


## 14. Narrative Risks
Known risks, confusion points, and mitigation strategies (as stated in the source material):

- Risk: The portal function is poorly documented.
  - Source: “the result was poorly documented” / “It's not clearly documented”
- Risk: The Act I signage, procedures, and ownership are contradictory.
  - Source: “Security procedures that contradict each other” / “conflicting signs” / “Contractors who still think they own parts of the site”
- Risk: Act II could become endless deferral loops.
  - Mitigation (stated): “Structure Act II as three escalating wins, not endless deferrals” and “Each ‘redirect’ should drop something useful: a stamp, a badge, a form, a map fragment, a tool.”
