  “Before you say anything, this line is recorded for ‘process continuity.’ Which is not surveillance. Contractually.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_2
  “Right, so: the question is not ‘one tag.’ The question is: are you creating a traceable isolation condition that is comparable to full application. Comparable doesn’t mean identical. It means defensible, after the fact, in a room where nobody remembers you.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_TEMP
  “It counts as a marker. The lock counts as the lock. The tag counts as the communication of the lock. A temporary tag is— and I hate this phrase— a communication of a communication. Which is allowed, if documented as such, and if no one pretends it is anything else.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_WRITE
  “Write what you did. Not what you meant. Not what you were trying to do. Date/time. Device IDs. ‘Primary lock applied at main point.’ ‘TEMP tags affixed at subpoints due to inventory limitation.’ And note that the limitation is administrative, not improvisational. Improvisational implies agency.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_SIGNS
  “You sign your action. I witness your statement. I’m not authorizing. I’m not preventing. I’m creating a record that you said you complied. There’s a difference, and it is the only reason my job exists.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_PERSUADE_PASS
  “Use this: ‘Isolation established at primary lock point; subpoint TEMP tags applied as markers due to documented inventory limitation; photographs attached; device IDs cross-referenced to placard list.’ Boring. Specific. No adjectives. Adjectives are where blame hides.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_PERSUADE_FAIL
  “I can’t write your sentence for you. I can only tell you what auditors will ask: who, what, when, where, and the exact reason you deviated from ideal supply conditions.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_OLEA_1
  “Okay. That helps. Not because it changes physics. Because it changes who gets asked why the physics happened.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_PROVISIONAL_1
  “I will note: ‘Action taken under OLEA closure authority, pending record reconciliation.’ That is not acceptance. That is a sentence that prevents follow-up calls.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_RECORD_1
  “Just to be explicit: you are declaring the isolation condition established. I am recording your declaration. That is the cleanest wording we have.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / EAC_FINAL_1
  “LOTO documented. Which is the version of reality that survives.”
