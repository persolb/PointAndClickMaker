  Hi! You’ve reached Field Interface Support for SECV legacy devices.
  If you’re calling about abnormal output, anomalous imaging, unexpected reflective behavior, or anything that could be described as ‘nonstandard,’ that is not covered.
  
  We support: jams, rollers, trays, and manufacturer-listed error codes.
  We do not support: facilities, incidents, atmospheres, or ‘situations.’
  
  If this is about a service code—service codes are not a service issue.
  They are an authorization issue.
  Thank you for understanding, which is required.
