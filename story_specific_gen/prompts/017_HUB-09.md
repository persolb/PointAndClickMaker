PIXEL ART BACKGROUND PROMPT
Screen ID: HUB-09
Name: Conference Room (EAC Liaison)
Category: act1_interior

GLOBAL STYLE
PIXEL ART
- Native resolution: [640, 480]
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Upscale factor: 4×
- Output resolution: [1280, 720]
- Scaling algorithm: nearest-neighbor only
- Rendering constraints:
  - Anti-aliasing: False
  - Subpixel rendering: False
  - Blur filters: False
  - Line discipline: Build forms with clean pixel clusters; avoid stray single pixels (orphans).
- Perspective rules:
  - Viewpoint: 2D side-on with shallow depth (classic adventure style).
  - Horizon line: Upper third of the frame.
  - Convergence: Mild convergence toward the background to create depth; avoid full isometric.
  - Walkable area: Must be visually separated from non-walkable space via value (brightness) or texture contrast.
- Palette and shading:
  - Palette target: 24-32 distinct colors per scene (including UI-safe accents).
  - Shading ramps: Maximum of 3 tones per material (base, shadow, highlight).
  - Lighting direction: Upper-left light source; soft shadows cast to lower-right.
  - Dither usage: Used sparingly. Permitted only for atmospheric haze/sky gradients or very worn asphalt. Do not dither solid objects.
  - Gradient policy: No smooth airbrush gradients; use solid bands.
- Outlines: Selective outlining only. Use dark edges on high-contrast boundaries to separate depth planes. Avoid full black outlines around every object.
- Texture vocabulary:
  - Asphalt: Chunky speckle clusters + defined cracks. Create 2–3 cluster shapes and reuse them to establish a visual vocabulary.
  - Metal: Repeating vertical rhythm, minimal internal detail. Rely on strong silhouettes + 1 highlight ramp.
  - Vegetation: Leaf masses defined as 3–5 pixel clusters. Strictly avoid single-pixel 'noise grass'.
  - Micro-noise policy: Zero tolerance for random single-pixel noise (shimmers in motion).
SIGNAGE
- Text style: Blocky, pixel-perfect text. Must be readable at 4× scale. Keep word count minimal.
- Tone: Dry, bureaucratic, official, or neglected.
- Humor rule: Subtle environmental storytelling (e.g. contradictory rules); never overt slapstick.
HOTSPOTS
- Visual rule: Distinct silhouette required. Must have a 'value halo' (lighter background behind dark object, or vice-versa).
- Placement strategy: Keep hotspots clear of high-frequency background noise to ensure cursor readability.

SCREEN ART NOTES
- shot_type: interior medium
- camera: 2D side-on; shallow depth; table as interaction surface
- lighting: office neutral; slightly flatter than hallway
- composition: Table is the interaction plane; liaison’s paperwork stack is staged as a clean hotspot cluster

REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT ELEMENTS
- Long table with chairs and one active desk lamp
- Printer tray for finding slips
- Whiteboard with process terms and crossed-out headings

INTENDED HOTSPOTS (FOR SILHOUETTE / VALUE PLANNING)
- EAC Finding Slip printer tray — Single sheet protruding; red stamp mark visible
- Checklist folder — Thick tabbed binder; looks newly placed
- Whiteboard notes — Large block letters; one key phrase circled

ADJACENT SCREENS AND TRANSITIONS
- To HUB-06 — Admin Lobby and Kiosk
  - Direction: left
  - Transition: door to lobby
  - Continuity cues: Kiosk hum returns; doors re-space as exits
  - REFERENCE_IMAGE: story_specific_gen/images/HUB-06.png

SEAM CONTINUITY GUIDANCE
- Keep edge landmarks aligned with adjacent screens (fence line, doorway framing, signage family).
- Preserve consistent material textures (reuse asphalt/fence/vegetation cluster vocabulary).
