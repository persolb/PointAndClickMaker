- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_WIDEN_PROMPT
  SELECT JUSTIFICATION:
  A) INSTRUMENT DRIFT COMPENSATION
  B) ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE REBASELINE
  C) LEGACY SENSOR CROSS-CALIBRATION
  D) OTHER (REQUIRES MEMO ATTACHMENT)
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_RAISE_TRIP
  REMINDER: RAISING TRIP POINT MAY ALTER EVENT CLASSIFICATION.
  CLASSIFICATION IS NOT A TECHNICAL CHANGE.
  (That sentence is here for liability.)
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_RECLASSIFY_LEGACY
  CONFIRM: ALIGNMENT ADVISORY → LEGACY CATEGORY
  EFFECT: EVENTS WILL PRINT TO LOG AND REQUIRE MANUAL REVIEW.
  NOTE: MANUAL REVIEW IS A CONTROL, NOT A DELAY.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_ROUTE_MAINT_2
  ROUTE CHANGE REQUIRES SIGN-OFF: SUPERVISOR OR CLOSURE AUTHORITY.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_DISABLE_AUTO
  ACKNOWLEDGE: YOU ARE MAKING HUMANS RESPONSIBLE AGAIN.
  CHECKBOX LABEL: “ACCEPT OPERATOR BURDEN.”
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_TWOSTEP_INTRO
  DELIBERATE INVOCATION GATE:
  STEP 1: LOCAL ENABLE (KEYSWITCH OR CODE)
  STEP 2: PROCEDURE REFERENCE + LOGGED ATTESTATION
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_SET_MEAS_ARTIFACT
  DEFAULT EVENT TEXT PREVIEW:
  “Anomalous alignment reading consistent with instrument variance; pending verification.”
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_OLEA_POLICY
  APPLYING POLICY TEXT:
  “Suppression under nominal operation; deliberate invocation only under controlled conditions.”
  This does not describe capability.
  It describes responsibility.
  (Responsibility is cheaper.)
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_EXECUTE_PROMPT
  CONFIRM EXECUTION:
  - Function suppressed under nominal operation.
  - Invocation available only by deliberate, controlled procedure.
  - Logs will frame anomalies as measurement artifact pending verification.
  This is an operational posture, not a discovery.
