PIXEL ART BACKGROUND PROMPT
Screen ID: HUB-10
Name: Operations Corridor (Interlocks and LOTO)
Category: act1_operations

GLOBAL STYLE
PIXEL ART
- Native resolution: [640, 480]
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Upscale factor: 4×
- Output resolution: [1280, 720]
- Scaling algorithm: nearest-neighbor only
- Rendering constraints:
  - Anti-aliasing: False
  - Subpixel rendering: False
  - Blur filters: False
  - Line discipline: Build forms with clean pixel clusters; avoid stray single pixels (orphans).
- Perspective rules:
  - Viewpoint: 2D side-on with shallow depth (classic adventure style).
  - Horizon line: Upper third of the frame.
  - Convergence: Mild convergence toward the background to create depth; avoid full isometric.
  - Walkable area: Must be visually separated from non-walkable space via value (brightness) or texture contrast.
- Palette and shading:
  - Palette target: 24-32 distinct colors per scene (including UI-safe accents).
  - Shading ramps: Maximum of 3 tones per material (base, shadow, highlight).
  - Lighting direction: Upper-left light source; soft shadows cast to lower-right.
  - Dither usage: Used sparingly. Permitted only for atmospheric haze/sky gradients or very worn asphalt. Do not dither solid objects.
  - Gradient policy: No smooth airbrush gradients; use solid bands.
- Outlines: Selective outlining only. Use dark edges on high-contrast boundaries to separate depth planes. Avoid full black outlines around every object.
- Texture vocabulary:
  - Asphalt: Chunky speckle clusters + defined cracks. Create 2–3 cluster shapes and reuse them to establish a visual vocabulary.
  - Metal: Repeating vertical rhythm, minimal internal detail. Rely on strong silhouettes + 1 highlight ramp.
  - Vegetation: Leaf masses defined as 3–5 pixel clusters. Strictly avoid single-pixel 'noise grass'.
  - Micro-noise policy: Zero tolerance for random single-pixel noise (shimmers in motion).
SIGNAGE
- Text style: Blocky, pixel-perfect text. Must be readable at 4× scale. Keep word count minimal.
- Tone: Dry, bureaucratic, official, or neglected.
- Humor rule: Subtle environmental storytelling (e.g. contradictory rules); never overt slapstick.
HOTSPOTS
- Visual rule: Distinct silhouette required. Must have a 'value halo' (lighter background behind dark object, or vice-versa).
- Placement strategy: Keep hotspots clear of high-frequency background noise to ensure cursor readability.

SCREEN ART NOTES
- shot_type: interior corridor
- camera: 2D side-on; shallow depth; interlock panels readable
- lighting: industrial fluorescent; occasional warning strobes
- composition: Interlock panel and door are the primary read; LOTO points are placed in a clean sequence along the wall

REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT ELEMENTS
- Door interlock that demands training date token
- LOTO lock points for main and subpoints
- Panel labels with conflicting terms across eras
- Ventilation status indicator tied to damper

INTENDED HOTSPOTS (FOR SILHOUETTE / VALUE PLANNING)
- Training date interlock panel — Large status lights; single blank field draws attention
- LOTO main lock point — Oversized hasp; empty tag loop invites action
- Ventilation status indicator — Simple OPEN/CLOSED legend; one stuck state
- Procedure placard stack — Three placards disagree; aligned so conflict is obvious

ADJACENT SCREENS AND TRANSITIONS
- To HUB-07 — Records Hallway and Tube Station
  - Direction: hotspot
  - Transition: hallway to_records_hall
  - Continuity cues: Records seal and tube station reappear
  - REFERENCE_IMAGE: story_specific_gen/images/HUB-07.png
- To HUB-11 — Control Room
  - Direction: right
  - Transition: enter_control_room
  - Continuity cues: Ambient hum changes to equipment whine
- To HUB-05 — Service Corridor and Duct Access
  - Direction: left
  - Transition: service_corridor_return
  - Continuity cues: Duct access and cable trays come back into view

SEAM CONTINUITY GUIDANCE
- Keep edge landmarks aligned with adjacent screens (fence line, doorway framing, signage family).
- Preserve consistent material textures (reuse asphalt/fence/vegetation cluster vocabulary).
