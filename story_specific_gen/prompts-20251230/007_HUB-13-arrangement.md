Create an image that is a sketch showing where each hotspot and navigation should be for this point-and-click game screen.

Each screen edge (left, right, top, bottom) may contain at most one exit. An exit is defined as a transition to one and only one adjacent screen. Multiple destinations may not share a single edge, path, or walkable corridor. If multiple narrative destinations exist, they must be distributed across distinct edges or be an onscreen hotspot (like a seperate door/road).

Don't list the same exit or hotspot twice.

Only make a line sketch so an artist has a guideline. No shading, colors, etc.

## SCREEN ART NOTES
- shot_type: interior dramatic wide
- camera: 2D side-on; shallow depth; sphere centered as primary mass
- composition: Containment sphere is centered and set into a shallow recessed cradle/pit so the player stands slightly above its equator. Overall machine height reads ~12 ft (about twice the player), with the recess giving it weight and containment context. Witness marker tape defines the safe perimeter; one interface panel reads as the action point.
- important details: Containment sphere centered in chamber, seated in a shallow recessed cradle/pit; floor witness marker tape and hazard tags; emergency stop and status indicator cluster; interface panel with barcode-like scan area (human labeling, inconsistent); intermittent mirror-state glints during phase-lock
