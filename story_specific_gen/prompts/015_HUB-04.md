PIXEL ART BACKGROUND PROMPT
Screen ID: HUB-04
Name: Exterior Ground Service Hatch
Category: act1_service_exterior

GLOBAL STYLE
PIXEL ART
- Native resolution: [640, 480]
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Upscale factor: 4×
- Output resolution: [1280, 720]
- Scaling algorithm: nearest-neighbor only
- Rendering constraints:
  - Anti-aliasing: False
  - Subpixel rendering: False
  - Blur filters: False
  - Line discipline: Build forms with clean pixel clusters; avoid stray single pixels (orphans).
- Perspective rules:
  - Viewpoint: 2D side-on with shallow depth (classic adventure style).
  - Horizon line: Upper third of the frame.
  - Convergence: Mild convergence toward the background to create depth; avoid full isometric.
  - Walkable area: Must be visually separated from non-walkable space via value (brightness) or texture contrast.
- Palette and shading:
  - Palette target: 24-32 distinct colors per scene (including UI-safe accents).
  - Shading ramps: Maximum of 3 tones per material (base, shadow, highlight).
  - Lighting direction: Upper-left light source; soft shadows cast to lower-right.
  - Dither usage: Used sparingly. Permitted only for atmospheric haze/sky gradients or very worn asphalt. Do not dither solid objects.
  - Gradient policy: No smooth airbrush gradients; use solid bands.
- Outlines: Selective outlining only. Use dark edges on high-contrast boundaries to separate depth planes. Avoid full black outlines around every object.
- Texture vocabulary:
  - Asphalt: Chunky speckle clusters + defined cracks. Create 2–3 cluster shapes and reuse them to establish a visual vocabulary.
  - Metal: Repeating vertical rhythm, minimal internal detail. Rely on strong silhouettes + 1 highlight ramp.
  - Vegetation: Leaf masses defined as 3–5 pixel clusters. Strictly avoid single-pixel 'noise grass'.
  - Micro-noise policy: Zero tolerance for random single-pixel noise (shimmers in motion).
SIGNAGE
- Text style: Blocky, pixel-perfect text. Must be readable at 4× scale. Keep word count minimal.
- Tone: Dry, bureaucratic, official, or neglected.
- Humor rule: Subtle environmental storytelling (e.g. contradictory rules); never overt slapstick.
HOTSPOTS
- Visual rule: Distinct silhouette required. Must have a 'value halo' (lighter background behind dark object, or vice-versa).
- Placement strategy: Keep hotspots clear of high-frequency background noise to ensure cursor readability.

SCREEN ART NOTES
- shot_type: exterior close / utility access
- camera: 2D side-on; shallow depth; framing tight on hatch and immediate surroundings
- lighting: overcast daylight; darker cavity value under hatch lid
- composition: Hatch opening dominates foreground; the fence base and road edge provide orientation back to HUB-01. Interior ladder/steps and a lit service door are visible, clearly implying a path deeper inside.

REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT ELEMENTS
- Flush ground service hatch with lifting ring and stenciled identifier
- Shallow access pit with ladder/steps and conduit runs
- Small service landing with a single exterior-rated door leading to the service corridor
- Era cues: 80s industrial hardware and conduit; newer patchwork labels layered over older paint

INTENDED HOTSPOTS (FOR SILHOUETTE / VALUE PLANNING)
- Hatch lid and lifting ring — High-contrast metal ring; clear hand interaction point
- Access ladder/steps — Strong vertical lines; shadowed depth cue
- Service door — Single door with bright perimeter seal; obvious destination

ADJACENT SCREENS AND TRANSITIONS
- To HUB-01 — Approach Road and Main Gate
  - Direction: hotspot
  - Transition: climb_out_of_hatch
  - Continuity cues: Road edge, fence posts, and hatch surround align with HUB-01 placement
  - REFERENCE_IMAGE: story_specific_gen/images/HUB-01.png
- To HUB-05 — Service Corridor and Duct Access
  - Direction: right
  - Transition: door
  - Continuity cues: Conduit bundles and label style continue into the corridor; exterior light falls off behind the player

SEAM CONTINUITY GUIDANCE
- Keep edge landmarks aligned with adjacent screens (fence line, doorway framing, signage family).
- Preserve consistent material textures (reuse asphalt/fence/vegetation cluster vocabulary).
