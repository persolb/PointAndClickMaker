Create an image that is a sketch showing where each hotspot and navigation should be for this point-and-click game screen.

Each screen edge (left, right, top, bottom) may contain at most one exit. An exit is defined as a transition to one and only one adjacent screen. Multiple destinations may not share a single edge, path, or walkable corridor. If multiple narrative destinations exist, they must be distributed across distinct edges or be an onscreen hotspot (like a seperate door/road).

Don't list the same exit or hotspot twice.

Only make a line sketch so an artist has a guideline. No shading, colors, etc.

## SCREEN ART NOTES
- shot_type: exterior close / utility access
- camera: 2D side-on; shallow depth; framing tight on hatch and immediate surroundings
- composition: Hatch opening dominates foreground; the fence base and road edge provide orientation back to HUB-01. Interior ladder/steps and a lit service door are visible, clearly implying a path deeper inside.
- important details: Fence base and road edge orient back to HUB-01; ladder/steps descend into shallow pit; lit service door visible as deeper destination

## HOTSPOTS
- Hatch lid and lifting ring
- Access ladder/steps
- Service door

## SCREENS TRANSITION POINTS
- Approach Road and Main Gate
  - Direction: onscreen
  - Transition: climb_out_of_hatch
- Service Corridor and Duct Access
  - Direction: right
  - Transition: open_service_door
