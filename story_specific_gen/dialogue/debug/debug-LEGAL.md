  If you are calling about “closure,” please note: closure is a fiscal classification, not a physical condition. If you are calling about a physical condition, you are calling the wrong department, for everyone’s benefit.

  If you need someone to cite, cite “Counsel Intake, extension listed.” Do not cite a name. Names become invitations.
