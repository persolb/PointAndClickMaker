# SECV_OPERATOR

- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N3
  SECV remote attendance. This line is recorded for quality and— sorry— for liability.
  How can I help you remain safe and also not become my problem today?
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_OPEN_1
  I can’t do that on request.
  I can do that when the system indicates an authorized presence on-site.
  Those are different things, and I’m required to respect the difference.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_VERIFY_1
  I can’t confirm identity.
  I can confirm whether someone with your name is scheduled to be here, which is not the same as being… you.
  It’s a comfort we provide to paperwork.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_SCHED_1
  Yes. You are scheduled for today under OLEA closeout activity.
  I’m saying “you” in the database sense. Not in the biological sense.
  The biological sense creates obligations.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_SCHED_2
  Scheduled is not onsite.
  Onsite is a status. A checkbox. A time-stamp. A chain of custody for blame.
  Without that, I can’t create a condition where you could get hurt and we have no record of why you were there.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_UNLOCKA_1
  I can’t.
  If I unlock on a voice request, I become the authorization event. And I am not licensed to be an event.
  I’m licensed to be a response.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_UNLOCKA_2
  To a valid onsite record, yes.
  To a person asking nicely, no— and you are asking nicely. I’m noting that for my own mental health.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_REQ_1
  A Temporary Presence Receipt— or whatever they’re calling it this decade.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_REQ_2
  It needs your name, date, activity type, and a site designation that says “onsite” instead of “expected.”
  Once that exists, I can treat you as an accountable entity and actuate the vestibule door without… inventing you.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_REQ_3
  In the old days: walk to the Records window.
  In the current days: locate whoever has Records authority, or locate the stamp, or locate the pneumatic tube instructions that pretend Records still has staff.
  I’m not being sarcastic. That is the procedure.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_REQ_CONFIRM_1
  Correct.
  Presence is paperwork. Paperwork is permission. Permission is how we keep injuries orderly.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_DETAILS_1
  Scheduled party: Field Systems Specialist, OLEA.
  Activity: closure verification and staged shutdown prep.
  Window: today through end-of-day, with a note that access is “subject to onsite confirmation.”
  That last clause is the one that keeps me employed.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_DETAILS_2
  I can’t transmit personal schedule details to an unverified caller.
  If you obtain a Presence Receipt from Records, I can attach the confirmation to the onsite event. Then it’s no longer personal; it’s operational.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_OLEA_1
  I do rely on the work order— as evidence you’re scheduled.
  Authority doesn’t travel through a speaker. It travels through fields in a database.
  If you want me to act on the work order, you need the onsite marker from Records so the work order has a location to attach to.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_OLEA_2
  Once Records says you exist here, I can do doors. I can do cameras. I can do timed unlocks.
  Until then, I can do empathy, and I’m already at my daily limit.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_END_CALL_LINE
  Copy. Call back when you’re onsite.
  Which I understand you currently cannot become.
  Have a safe not-presence.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_0
  SECV remote attendance. This line is recorded for quality and—sorry—for liability.
  How can I help you remain safe and also not become my problem today?
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_ONSITE_1
  Vestibule is not onsite in the database sense.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_ONSITE_2
  It’s… a conceptual holding area. A room that contains you without asserting you exist.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_ONSITE_3
  Onsite is a status: timestamped, attributable, auditable. If it doesn’t generate blame, it doesn’t generate access.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_ROOM_1
  Use it to produce a Records-shaped event.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_ROOM_2
  A Presence Receipt, a stamp, a kiosk printout—anything that lets me attach a door action to an authorized condition.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_ROOM_3
  I’m not refusing help. I’m refusing authorship.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_BADGES_1
  It helps in the way a blank form helps.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_BADGES_2
  It doesn’t make you authorized. It makes it easier to claim you followed procedure, which is… adjacent.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_BADGES_3
  If you can get a Records marker on one of those artifacts, then I can treat you as an accountable entity and do doors.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_OLEA_1
  I can note you called. I can’t note you exist onsite.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_OLEA_2
  Authority doesn’t travel through a speaker. It travels through fields in a database, and those fields have to be populated by Records or an authorized kiosk workflow.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_OLEA_3
  If I mark you present without that, I become the event. And I am not licensed to be an event. I’m licensed to be a response.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_MIN_1
  Name, date, activity type, site designation that says “onsite,” and some form of Records authority indicator.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_MIN_2
  A stamp is traditional. A kiosk receipt is acceptable. A handwritten note is… historically popular, and legally fragile.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_SECV_ENDCALL_1
  Copy. Call back when you’re onsite.
  Which I understand you currently cannot become.
  Have a safe not-presence.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_SECV_0
  SECV remote attendance. This line is recorded for quality and—sorry—for liability.
  How can I help you remain safe and also not become my problem today?
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_UNLOCK_1
  I can do that when the system indicates an authorized onsite presence.
  If I do it because a voice asked, I become the authorization event, and I am not licensed to be an event.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_UNLOCK_2
  Do you have a Presence Receipt—“onsite,” not “expected”? The wording matters in a way I hate.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_INDICATES_1
  A record I can attach my action to: name, date, activity type, site designation set to onsite, plus a Records authority marker.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_INDICATES_2
  I don’t need your face. I need the checkbox that makes your face someone else’s responsibility.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_SHOW_1
  Okay. Thank you for saying it that way.
  I still can’t verify identity—just to be extremely clear before anyone gets creative later—but I can verify whether an onsite presence record exists under your name.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_READBACK_1
  Minimum, yes. Because maximum becomes “personal information” and then I become a different kind of problem.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_READBACK_2
  I can confirm: scheduled party matches a Field Systems Specialist under OLEA closeout activity, dated today, status: onsite.
  That is the entire universe I’m allowed to live in.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_SCHED_1
  I can confirm you are scheduled in the database sense.
  I can’t confirm you are you, because then I’m in the business of judgment, and my contract is specifically allergic to judgment.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_SCHED_2
  If you are marked onsite with a Presence Receipt, I can attach my confirmation to that event and it becomes operational, not personal.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_SCHED_WHY_1
  Scheduled is an intention. Onsite is a status.
  Intention doesn’t generate blame. Status does.
  Access follows blame. That’s not my philosophy. That’s the architecture.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_OLEA_1
  I do treat the work order as authority—to the extent it proves you’re expected.
  Authority does not travel through a speaker. It travels through fields in a database.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_OLEA_2
  If Records has marked you onsite, then the work order has a location to attach to, and I can do doors without inventing a person.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_TIME_1
  I do. And I’m not indifferent, I’m constrained.
  Time sensitivity is not an authorization category. It’s just… a feeling people bring to doors.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_COMMIT_0
  Copy. I am searching the onsite ledger now.
  If this takes more than a moment, it’s not because I doubt you. It’s because the system likes to think before it takes responsibility.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_COMMIT_2
  Okay. I have an onsite presence record that matches your name and today’s date, activity type: closeout.
  That is sufficient for me to actuate interior access without becoming the story.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_COMMIT_4
  Initiating a timed unlock on the guard shack interior door.
  You’ll have a short window. If it relocks, it’s not personal—nothing here is personal on purpose.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_ENDCALL_1
  Copy. Ending the call.
  If you need another door to become a record, you know where to press.
