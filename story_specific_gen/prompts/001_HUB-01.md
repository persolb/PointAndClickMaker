GLOBAL STYLE
PIXEL ART
- Native resolution: [640, 480]
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Upscale factor: 4×
- Output resolution: [1280, 720]
- Scaling algorithm: nearest-neighbor only
- Rendering constraints:
  - Anti-aliasing: False
  - Subpixel rendering: False
  - Blur filters: False
  - Line discipline: Build forms with clean pixel clusters; avoid stray single pixels (orphans).
- Perspective rules:
  - Viewpoint: 2D side-on with shallow depth (classic adventure style).
  - Horizon line: Upper third of the frame.
  - Convergence: Mild convergence toward the background to create depth; avoid full isometric.
  - Walkable area: Must be visually separated from non-walkable space via value (brightness) or texture contrast.
- Palette and shading:
  - Palette target: 24-32 distinct colors per scene (including UI-safe accents).
  - Shading ramps: Maximum of 3 tones per material (base, shadow, highlight).
  - Lighting direction: Upper-left light source; soft shadows cast to lower-right.
  - Dither usage: Used sparingly. Permitted only for atmospheric haze/sky gradients or very worn asphalt. Do not dither solid objects.
  - Gradient policy: No smooth airbrush gradients; use solid bands.
- Outlines: Selective outlining only. Use dark edges on high-contrast boundaries to separate depth planes. Avoid full black outlines around every object.
- Texture vocabulary:
  - Asphalt: Chunky speckle clusters + defined cracks. Create 2–3 cluster shapes and reuse them to establish a visual vocabulary.
  - Metal: Repeating vertical rhythm, minimal internal detail. Rely on strong silhouettes + 1 highlight ramp.
  - Vegetation: Leaf masses defined as 3–5 pixel clusters. Strictly avoid single-pixel 'noise grass'.
  - Micro-noise policy: Zero tolerance for random single-pixel noise (shimmers in motion).
SIGNAGE
- Text style: Blocky, pixel-perfect text. Must be readable at 4× scale. Keep word count minimal.
- Tone: Dry, bureaucratic, official, or neglected.
- Humor rule: Subtle environmental storytelling (e.g. contradictory rules); never overt slapstick.
HOTSPOTS
- Visual rule: Distinct silhouette required. Must have a 'value halo' (lighter background behind dark object, or vice-versa).
- Placement strategy: Keep hotspots clear of high-frequency background noise to ensure cursor readability.

SCREEN ART NOTES
- shot_type: exterior wide establishing
- camera: 2D side-on; shallow depth; mild convergence toward gate
- lighting: overcast daylight; soft shadows
- composition: Primary read: cracked road → chained sliding gate. Secondary reads: guard shack visible inside/right of the fence line; behind it, the admin lobby block (HUB-06) is visible through/behind fence as a 1979 office façade. Foreground includes a flush ground service hatch near the road edge that reads as an intentional access point.

REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT ELEMENTS
- Cracked asphalt approach road with converging wear lines
- Chain-link fence and main sliding gate with barbed-wire silhouette
- Layered signage: official site sign, safety sign, sun-bleached contractor notice
- Distant facility silhouette softened by haze; thin ridge security lights (80s build language)
- Newer-than-everything conduit run to a small instrument box
- Guard shack (HUB-02) visible behind the fence line to the right, with porch overhang silhouette
- Admin lobby block (HUB-06) visible beyond/behind the guard shack on the far side of the fence; reads as 1979 office construction (beige panels, narrow windows)
- Exterior ground service hatch (HUB-04) near foreground/road edge; flush cover with lifting ring and stenciled ID

INTENDED HOTSPOTS (FOR SILHOUETTE / VALUE PLANNING)
- Car trunk / equipment case — Foreground silhouette; highest contrast; isolated from other props
- Gate keypad and receipt slot — Centered at hand height; small paper curl catches light
- Layered signpost — Stacked rectangles with mismatched fonts; readable at a glance
- Debris pile by fence line — Clean outline against fence; separated from clutter
- Instrument conduit box — Fresh paint and straight lines; looks newer than surroundings
- Exterior ground service hatch — Flush rectangle in clean ground space; lifting ring and stencil make it unmistakable

ADJACENT SCREENS AND TRANSITIONS
- To HUB-02 — Guard Shack Exterior
  - Direction: right
  - Transition: walk_along_fence
  - Continuity cues: Fence line continues; guard shack grows from background element to primary subject
- To HUB-04 — Exterior Ground Service Hatch
  - Direction: down
  - Transition: open_ground_service_hatch
  - Continuity cues: Hatch location remains consistent relative to road cracks and fence post landmarks
- To HUB-06 — Admin Lobby and Kiosk
  - Direction: hotspot
  - Transition: walk_through_gate
  - Continuity cues: Admin lobby block seen behind fence becomes reachable as an interior entry; guard shack remains nearby behind fence

SEAM CONTINUITY GUIDANCE
- Keep edge landmarks aligned with adjacent screens (fence line, doorway framing, signage family).
- Preserve consistent material textures (reuse asphalt/fence/vegetation cluster vocabulary).
