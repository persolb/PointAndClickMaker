  Before you say anything: if this is about the training date, it is not “expired.”
  “Expired” implies it was valid for a duration we agreed on. We never agreed on that.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_COMPLIANCE_RANGE
  Correct. “Range” is the safe word we use when Legal is in the room.
  Your training record has a date. The interlock reads the date.
  The date does not match the current approved date window for work that could be interpreted as—
  I’m not saying you’re doing it. I’m saying the interlock can’t know your heart.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_COMPLIANCE_FIX
  Officially? A training update, processed, posted, and ingested by the interlock system.
  Unofficially? I am not allowed to have unofficially.
  
  Also, do not write “I needed access.” Write “access required by closure checklist.” That phrasing holds up better.

  Policy Rev 7B defines the window; it’s not a calendar concept, it’s a risk classification concept.
  Authorization is routed through Records for changes that touch interlock ingestion.
  If you quote me: quote the document, not my mouth.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_COMPLIANCE_FAIL
  No. If I say the window out loud, it becomes advice.
  You want the policy text. You do not want me.

  Ownership is a legal category. Physically, it’s a hallway.
  Procedurally, it’s a boundary.
  If you need a single name, you want Records, not me.
