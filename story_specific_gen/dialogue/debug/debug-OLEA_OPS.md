# OLEA_OPS

- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_OPS_INTRO_TOP
  OLEA Ops, line recorded, unofficially.
  That means it’s recorded, but we don’t have to admit we recorded it unless someone asks in the correct way.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_CONFIRM_OPS_TOP
  If you’re at the exterior hatch with the lifting ring, yes.
  There are three exterior hatches, but only one is “Exterior Ground Service Hatch” in the index, because the index was updated after—never mind.
  You’re where you’re supposed to be, on paper.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_MAINT_OPS_TOP
  It isn’t “current.” It’s “kept from becoming noncompliant.”
  There’s a difference that matters during reviews.
  Minimal loads require minimal access, and minimal access requires maximal signage. That’s just how the funding language works.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_HAZ_OPS_TOP
  Standard confined-space concerns, except it’s not classified as confined because it’s “shallow.”
  So treat it as confined, but don’t call it that in writing unless you want a reclassification ticket opened, because that triggers a pause, and a pause triggers questions.
  Also: watch for condensation on the door. Not for safety. For… tracking. We had an issue with fingerprints being interpreted as “unauthorized presence.”
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_LOG_PASS_TOP
  I can log “arrived at exterior ground service hatch” with no problem.
  “Service access reached” is a phrase that implies you are going to interact with load wake controls, which implies the controls are present, which implies we acknowledge their condition.
  But. Since you’re the Field Systems Specialist and you’re physically present, I can log it as:
  “Service access point reached for verification of minimal building loads.”
  That way it’s verification, not activation. Words matter. I didn’t invent that.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_LOG_FAIL_TOP
  I can’t log that phrase under your name without a supervisor concurrence.
  Not because I don’t believe you—because belief is not a field on the form.
  If you want it logged, send a photo of the placard and a timestamp, and I can log “visual confirmation pending.”
  Which is what we do when we want something to exist without admitting it exists yet.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_END_TOP_2
  Stay present. That’s the job.
  And if anything looks “reflective,” that’s not a technical term, that’s just me being tired. End call.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_OPS_INTRO_PIT
  Still with me.
  Don’t say “down here” on the recording. It implies a depth classification.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_DOOR_OPS_PIT
  It’s a door. It opens until it doesn’t.
  If the gasket is swollen, don’t force it—forcing gets written up as “improper actuation.”
  If it opens easily, that gets written up as “unexpected lack of resistance,” so either way, be normal about it.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_NONLOCAL_OPS_PIT
  It’s… notices. About standards. From outside jurisdictions.
  We store them because we’re not supposed to ignore them, and we’re also not supposed to adopt them without a steering committee, and the steering committee was dissolved for cost savings.
  So they exist in storage. Like the site. Comparable situation.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_END_PIT_2
  Good. Keep it boring.
