# SAFETY_WINDOW

- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N01_WINDOW_ACK
  Window Five acknowledges presence.
  Do not state your destination. That creates a record we can’t support.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N03_WINDOW_EXPLAIN
  Glove tags are not “needed.”
  They are issued to reduce the number of hands that become— temporarily uncountable.
  Which is a safety category. Not an incident category. We’re not doing incidents today.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N10_NEED_TER
  I can’t “issue it” to an unanchored record.
  Provide TER issuance confirmation.
  Not your name. Not your intent. Just the TER.
  I’m protecting you. Also me.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N20_WHAT_IS
  It is a glove tag.
  It tags gloves. It also tags the person who says they have gloves.
  The second part is the part everyone pretends is optional until it isn’t.
  If you require a comparable term: it is a service-route token. But do not call it that at the counter.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N21_CATEGORY_PROMPT
  Would you like it issued under “hand protection,” or under “accountability”?
  The physical object is the same. The paperwork behaves differently.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N23_DIFF
  “Hand protection” assumes you will touch things you’re allowed to touch.
  “Accountability” assumes you will touch things you were never briefed on.
  Neither option implies permission. I need to say that clearly.
  
  Pick one so the printer stops asking me questions.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N40_ROUTING_EXPLAIN
  Safety does not handle routing.
  Safety handles what happens when routing happens without a story attached.
  Facilities wanted to handle it. Legal wanted to handle it. Intake tried once and the forms came back… wet.
  So we issue the token and we call it PPE. Everyone sleeps.
  
  If you are about to say “that sounds like access,” don’t.
  Access is a different window number. Different liability.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N45_OLEA_GATE_RESPONSE
  Acknowledged: external audit language detected.
  Audit language does not substitute for TER issuance confirmation.
  It does, however, make my log feel seen.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N50_TER_HOLD_UP
  Hold it up to the glass.
  Not the slot. The slot is for objects that have already been approved by the slot.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N52_TER_ACK
  TER acknowledged.
  Act Two routing constraints detected. Love that for us.
  
  Select issuance category: “hand protection” or “accountability.”
  Answer out loud. The system does not read nods.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N54_ALIVE_RESPONSE
  Neither.
  The tag does not keep you alive. It keeps you fileable.
  Please answer the question as asked.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N60_HP_SELECTED
  Hand protection selected.
  This does not imply the hands are yours. That’s between you and Intake.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N63_HP_NO_GLOVES
  Then you are requesting a glove event, not a glove tag.
  Different checklist. Longer feelings.
  
  Use the orientation rack. Window 3. They love helping. It makes them feel real.
  Then come back and say “hand protection” again, exactly. Not “PPE.” PPE is plural and the system panics.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N71_HP_GLOVE_DETECTED
  Glove detected.
  Integrity acceptable. We are not testing cleanliness. This is Safety, not Morality.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N73_HP_WARN
  Glove tag issued.
  Do not lend it. Do not trade it. Do not “temporarily” hand it to anyone with a nicer badge.
  If it ends up in a corridor without you attached, we will assume the corridor acquired you.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N80_ACC_SELECTED
  Accountability selected.
  Thank you for your honesty. I cannot reward it, but I can document it.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N82_ACC_INSERT_PROMPT
  Insert one glove. Left or right. Not both.
  If you do not have gloves, say so now so I can pretend this was your choice.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N84_ACC_NO_GLOVES
  Logged: “No gloves present at time of accountability selection.”
  That sentence will outlive you. In a good way. Mostly.
  
  Acquire gloves from Window 3. Return here. Repeat the same words.
  Do not improvise synonyms. This system treats synonyms as fraud.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N91_ACC_GLOVE_DETECTED
  Glove detected.
  Accountability chain initialized. Please remain— actually, do not remain. Remaining creates loitering.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N93_ACC_WARN
  Glove tag issued.
  This is not access. This is traceability.
  If a door recognizes it, that is the door’s personal failing.
