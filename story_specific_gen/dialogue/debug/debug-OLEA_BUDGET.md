  …not “return,” it’s a— it’s a reversion to the prior facility state. Words matter because funding follows words—
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N513_RADIO_BUDGET_2
  I’m not litigating verbs, I’m saying the completion bonus is contingent on presence at the closure site, and if we define the site as—
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N515_RADIO_BUDGET_3
  Third party? There is no third party. It’s municipal infrastructure. It’s ours by default—
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_BORING_BUD1
  Just so we’re aligned: this is a retirement deliverable, not a… reclassification event.
  If your memo contains the shape of a “finding,” Finance will treat it as a new category, and the category will outlive you.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_BORING_BUD2
  Good. Say “completion of standard retirement checklist steps,” “documentation of operational state for retirement,” and “fiscal window compliance.”
  Do not say anything that sounds like “discovery.” Even accidentally.
  Also—small note—don’t use adjectives that imply anyone was impressed.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_PRINT_BUD1
  Once it’s on paper, it becomes the plan. Not because it’s true—because it’s filed.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_BUDGET0
  Before you touch a verb: remember this is closure processing. Not a reclassification event. I know that sounds like the same thing. Finance does not.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ASKCAT_B
  Licensed relationship is fine if it stays in “municipal infrastructure.” The moment it smells like “research,” we lose a fiscal year to committees.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_SUBMIT_B
  Also don’t say “discovery.” Even as a joke. Jokes get transcribed like admissions.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_CATL_B
  If this lands, it closes exposure without changing the accounting story. Which is the only kind of miracle we’re funded for.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_CATT_B
  Good. Temporary. Processing. Those are words that don’t create obligations.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_REASON_LEGACY_B
  “Legacy municipal infrastructure” is a ledger category I can live with. Don’t make it a headline.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ATTACH_MEMO_B
  Make sure the memo title says “retirement processing.” Not “renegotiation.” Words get searched.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_BUDGET_HELLO
  I’m looking at the clock and the fiscal window is looking back. Where are we.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_BUDGET_02
  “Filed” is the correct verb. Keep it.
  Remember: this is a retirement deliverable, not a reclassification event.
  If the memo reads like a finding, Finance inherits it as an obligation. I don’t have a budget for obligations.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_BUDGET_03
  Records packet if you want defensibility. Tube if you want plausible deniability.
  Defensibility is slower but cheaper later.
  Plausible deniability is fast and becomes your personality.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_BUDGET_COST
  Use the retirement processing code. The one that looks boring on purpose.
  If you improvise a code, it becomes a new program.
  And then someone asks why we started a program.
