# RECORDS_CLERK

- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_LOOK_2
  If you’re reading the placard out loud, don’t.
  It doesn’t become binding twice.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_TALK_2
  This is Records, yes.
  If you’re here to “get in,” that’s not what happens.
  You provide a handle. I release a copy.
  No one “enters” the archive. That’s how the archive stays an archive.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_HANDLE_2
  Date, scope, and why you’re entitled to touch it without becoming the last person who touched it.
  Not personal. Procedural.
  And before you say “closure,” closure is not a scope.
  Closure is a mood.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SEAL_2
  Because the old seal was referenced incorrectly in a conversation that did not exist.
  So now we have a seal that matches the record of the seal.
  I don’t control the narrative. I control the staples.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_PRES_2
  Hold it up. Closer.
  Not because I don’t trust you—because the copier ink they use fades like it’s embarrassed.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_PRES_4
  All right. You exist in the building during a time when the building claims it was unoccupied.
  Which is… not my department.
  This establishes standing to request copies. Not standing to interpret them.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_VAR_2
  Say it slowly.
  If you say it fast, it turns into a different code, and then it’s my mistake forever.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_VAR_4
  Mm. Non-local compliance format.
  I’m not stating that as an opinion. The dashes are wrong for municipal.
  This explains the seal change without explaining anything else, which is ideal.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_PRESS_2
  It is a descriptor that allows the file to exist without implying jurisdiction.
  And I’m going to stop there because you’re asking me to understand.
  I can file this, or I can understand it. Pick one.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_REQ_2
  That’s three categories, not one request.
  Which is fine. It’s just… people who ask for three categories tend to be building a story.
  And stories are how we get reclassification events.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_REQ_4
  For billing: provide the cost center or the charge code.
  For schedules: provide the servicing entity, even if it’s “unknown.” We have an “unknown” bucket.
  For audit flags: I need the date range and the triggering standard. Or the memo title, if you’re lucky.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_ALREADY_2
  Plenty.
  Mostly labeled in ways that prevent you from enjoying it.
  And if I list it, you’ll ask why it’s labeled that way, and then we’re back to understanding.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_BOTH_2
  That’s… competent.
  Presence plus external-format variance is enough to open a request without opening a dispute.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_BOTH_4
  State your request in nouns.
  No verbs. Verbs imply intent.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_PERSUADE_2
  Okay—good. That’s a phrase that exists on paper.
  I don’t love the tone, but I can process the wording.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_PERSUADE_4
  I’m issuing a controlled packet: copies, not originals.
  You sign receipt, you initial each page set, you don’t annotate the pages, and you don’t “improve” the staples.
  If you improve the staples, the staples become evidence. I won’t do that again.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_COMMIT_2
  Accepted.
  You will receive: what exists, as filed, without summary.
  If something is missing, it is not missing. It is “unlocated.”
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_COMMIT_4
  Initial there. And there. And—no, not your signature. Initials.
  Signatures invite questions.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_COMMIT_6
  If you come back for originals, the answer is no in advance.
  Have a compliant day.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_01
  This is Records, yes.
  If you’re here to “get in,” that’s not what happens.
  You provide a handle. I release a copy.
  No one enters the archive. That’s how the archive stays an archive.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_02
  A memo is not a handle. A memo is a genre.
  Give me: title, references, date, and why you’re entitled to touch it without becoming the last person who touched it.
  Not personal. Procedural.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_03
  Say the MTA reference slowly.
  If you say it fast, it turns into a different code, and then it’s my mistake forever.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_04
  Mm. Non-local compliance format.
  I’m not stating that as an opinion. The dashes are wrong for municipal.
  Which is useful. It lets the file exist without me implying jurisdiction.
  
  State your request in nouns.
  No verbs. Verbs imply intent.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_05
  Okay—good. Those are phrases that already exist on paper.
  I can process “authority chain.” I cannot process “what it means.”
  
  For billing: cost center or charge code.
  For chain-of-custody: you initial each page set. Not sign. Signatures invite questions.
  And you don’t annotate. If you annotate, the annotation becomes the document’s personality.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_06
  Accepted.
  I’m issuing a controlled packet: copies, not originals.
  You sign receipt—no, you initial. Initials.
  
  If you want tube routing, say so now.
  Because if you tube it first, then bring me the aftermath, I become “after-the-fact,” and that is not a role I consent to.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_COMMIT_TUBE_01
  Fine.
  I will stamp receipt, I will log release, and I will watch you seal the capsule.
  Not because I don’t trust you. Because trust is not a form field.
  
  Do not write on the capsule.
  People write jokes. Jokes become exhibits.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_PACKET_ONLY
  Then you will carry it, and you will be the chain-of-custody.
  I’m saying that neutrally. People hear it as a compliment. It is not.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_CATEGORY
  “Retirement processing communication.”
  Not “incident.” Not “investigation.” Not “finding.”
  I’m not protecting you. I’m protecting the index.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_TUBE_REQ
  Destination code that already exists.
  If you invent a destination, you invent a department.
  Departments are how liabilities reproduce.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_STAMP
  Stamping is an action. Actions imply endorsement.
  What I can do is acknowledge receipt of a document that claims to exist.
  Which is somehow different, and if you ask me why, I will pretend I didn’t hear you.
