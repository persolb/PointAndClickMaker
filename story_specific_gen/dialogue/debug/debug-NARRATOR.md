# NARRATOR

- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_INTRO_1
  The approach road ends in a chain-link gate and a keypad mounted like an afterthought.
  Behind it: industrial quiet with a thin electrical hum that never quite stops. You feel it in your molars, briefly, and decide not to.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_INTRO_2
  A signpost stands by the keypad. Multiple placards are bolted to it in layers—some sun-bleached, some newer, all “official.”
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_INTRO_3
  Hotspots: Car trunk / equipment case. Gate keypad and receipt slot. Layered signpost. Debris pile by fence line. Instrument conduit box. Exterior ground service hatch.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SIGNPOST_DESC
  The top placard reads: SITE CLOSED — NO ENTRY — ACCESS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.
  Under it, partially visible: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL — USE KEYPAD — PRINT RECEIPT.
  Under that, older still: VISITOR CHECK-IN THIS WAY, with an arrow pointing directly at the locked gate.
  
  None of these are damaged. They are simply all true at once, which is not a category compliance recognizes.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_ASK_SIGNAGE_OWNER_NARR
  There’s no label indicating department, revision, or issuer. Someone removed the corners where that information usually lives.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_LOG_1
  You frame the signpost in your camera, making sure the contradictory lines are legible in the same shot. Your thumb hesitates half a second before you attach the note anyway.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_LOG_2
  You file: Nonconforming signage — contradictory access instruction at primary gate.
  Category: Compliance / Public-facing instruction conflict.
  Priority: Routine. You pick it because “urgent” invites meetings.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_LOG_3
  A new objective appears: Resolve signage conflict.
  The site remains shut. The record now exists.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_INTERCOM_DESC
  A brushed-metal speaker grille sits above the keypad. It looks newer than the fence.
  A small sticker says: FOR ASSISTANCE, PRESS AND STATE PURPOSE. The sticker has been re-applied at least twice.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_BADGE_B
  You hold your badge up to a small dome camera. The lens clicks as it tries to focus.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_KEYPAD_DESC
  The keypad is clean enough to be used, which suggests someone is being paid to be nearby without being here.
  A narrow slot beneath it is labeled: RECEIPT — RETAIN FOR YOUR RECORDS.
  
  The screen prompts: ENTER CODE OR SELECT: ASSISTANCE / VISITOR / MAINTENANCE.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_KEYPAD_MAINT
  You press MAINTENANCE. The screen pauses as if deciding whether you deserve to exist.
  
  It displays: MAINTENANCE REQUIRES ACTIVE SIGN-IN LOCATION. PLEASE PROCEED TO KIOSK.
  A printer inside the box whirs and produces a blank strip of paper anyway.
  
  The blank receipt feels accusatory in your hand.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_KEYPAD_VISITOR
  You press VISITOR. The screen immediately brightens, pleased with itself.
  
  It displays: WELCOME. SITE CLOSED. PLEASE WAIT FOR ESCORT.
  A printer whirs and issues a receipt stamped: WAITING.
  
  The gate remains closed.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_TRUNK_DESC
  In the trunk: an equipment case with your label maker, inspection tags, a battered tablet, and a binder spine that says CLOSURE — SPINDLE in faded ink.
  The binder is heavier than it needs to be, like it’s trying to win an argument.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_TRUNK_TABLET
  You power the tablet. It boots into the OLEA field form stack without asking questions, which is the closest thing it has to kindness.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_TRUNK_TAGS
  You thumb through tags: DO NOT OPERATE, OUT OF SERVICE, PENDING REVIEW.
  Nothing says THIS SIGN IS LYING, which feels like an omission.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_DEBRIS_DESC
  A neat pile of windblown trash collects where the fence meets a concrete footing: plastic wrap, a cracked hardhat, and a laminated notice face-down in the dirt.
  The notice is too muddy to read without committing to touching it.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_DEBRIS_LEAVE
  You let it be. The dirt is doing its own filing.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_DEBRIS_FLIP
  You flip it with a pen instead of your hand. The laminate is intact, which feels intentional.
  
  The notice reads: ALL POSTINGS MUST MATCH CURRENT ACCESS POLICY.
  No issuer. No date. No contact. Just a rule that can’t be satisfied.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_CONDUIT_DESC
  A metal conduit box sits by the fence with a padlock that has been replaced more recently than the bolts holding the box to the post.
  A label reads: INSTRUMENTATION — DO NOT DE-ENERGIZE, and someone has underlined “DO” twice.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_HATCH_DESC
  A ground-level hatch is set into the pavement off to the side. It has a service number stamped into it and paint marks from at least three different survey crews.
  It looks like an alternate way in that you are not authorized to discover.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_LEAVE_CONFIRM_ADMIN
  You can proceed, but you’ll be doing it without a dated note that says the signs were nonconforming when you arrived. That omission will not be neutral later.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_LEAVE_CONFIRM_GUARD
  You can walk over, sure. But if you don’t document the gate instructions first, you’ll be explaining later why you followed one sign and ignored another. Your throat tightens at the thought.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_LEAVE_CONFIRM_HATCH
  You can head down toward the service hatch area. If someone asks why you were “seeking alternate entry,” the cleanest answer is a timestamped photo of the sign stack. You don’t have it yet.
- SCN-002 / DG_SCN002_TRUNK_STARTER_KIT / START
  The car trunk is open. An equipment case sits inside like it has been waiting to be blamed.
  Next to it: a binder shell. White plastic. Hand-labeled: “Closure Package – SPINDLE Site (Draft).” The label is slightly off-center.
- SCN-002 / DG_SCN002_TRUNK_STARTER_KIT / CASE_DESC
  Hardhat. Safety glasses. A multimeter with the calibration sticker half-peeled.
  A roll of temporary labels. Blank inspection tags. A label maker that politely advertises LOW BATT.
  It’s the kind of kit that assumes you will document your own survival.
- SCN-002 / DG_SCN002_TRUNK_STARTER_KIT / BINDER_DESC
  The cover reads “Closure Package – SPINDLE Site (Draft).”
  “Draft” is underlined once, like someone wanted that to be true.
  The rings don’t quite close without a shove.
- SCN-002 / DG_SCN002_TRUNK_STARTER_KIT / PPE_FAIL
  Procedure note (OLEA): Donning occurs beyond the perimeter signage.
  You can’t make “compliant” start in the parking lot.
- SCN-002 / DG_SCN002_TRUNK_STARTER_KIT / PPE_PASS
  Perimeter condition satisfied. You can don PPE here—if you’re willing to treat the trunk like a staging table instead of a boundary.
- SCN-002 / DG_SCN002_TRUNK_STARTER_KIT / COLLECT_LINE
  You take the starter kit and the empty closure binder shell. The trunk feels lighter in a way that isn’t reassuring.
  Items secured: hardhat, safety glasses, multimeter, temporary label roll, blank inspection tag, label maker (low battery), closure binder shell.
  Paperwork completeness: +1.
- SCN-002 / DG_SCN002_TRUNK_STARTER_KIT / LEAVE_LINE
  You close the trunk. The latch catches on the first try, which is either luck or a future problem.
  Nothing is collected.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_START
  The main gate has a keypad, a narrow receipt slot, and a plastic dome that suggests a camera without promising it.
  A faded sticker claims: “ALL ACCESS ATTEMPTS ARE RECORDED FOR YOUR PROTECTION.”
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_LOOK_1
  The keypad is newer than the fence. The receipt slot is newer than the keypad.
  Someone has hand-labeled the slot: “EVIDENCE (DO NOT DISCARD).” The ink looks annoyed.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_LOOK_2
  A smaller notice, half-peeled: “ENTRY REQUIRES RECORDS AUTHORIZATION. QUESTIONS: RECORDS.”
  “RECORDS” has been underlined twice, like it’s a person who should feel shame.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_USE_1
  The keypad wakes with a soft beep that sounds like it’s documenting you.
  The display reads: “ENTER ACCESS CODE OR INITIATE ATTEMPT LOG.”
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_OLEA_INPUT
  The keypad accepts the keystrokes with careful enthusiasm.
  Then it pauses, as if consulting a larger, more cautious memory.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_OLEA_ASSERT
  You say it to the keypad because there’s no one else to say it to.
  The keypad does not contradict you. It just reclassifies you.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_DEFAULT_INPUT
  The keypad accepts the input politely, like it’s heard worse.
  The display pauses, then brightens with certainty.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_PRINTING
  A motor whirs. Paper begins to feed into the slot with the confidence of a policy.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_RECEIPT_LOOK_1
  The paper hangs halfway out, trembling slightly in the wind like it’s nervous to be official.
  You can read enough to know it’s formatted like a transaction.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_RECEIPT_LOOK_2
  “GATE ACCESS ATTEMPT RECEIPT”
  “REQUESTOR: [UNVERIFIED]”
  “AUTHORITY REQUIRED: RECORDS”
  “DISPOSITION: DOCUMENTED”
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_RECEIPT_LEAVE_1
  The receipt stays in the slot, flapping with quiet insistence.
  The gate does not reward restraint.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_TAKE_1
  You pull the receipt free. It tears cleanly on the perforation, like it’s practiced.
  The keypad beeps once—satisfied, not helpful.
- SCN-003 / SCN003_GATE_RECEIPT / N_TAKE_2
  The gate remains closed. Your attempt is now officially real.
  The receipt is evidence that you were here, and that Records wasn’t.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_01
  The signpost by the gate has been updated the way budgets get updated: by layering new certainty on top of old.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_02
  Three plates. Two agencies. One post.
  The bolts don’t match.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_03
  Top plate: DECOMMISSIONED — NO ENTRY — EFFECTIVE 09/14/2003. The logo is sun-faded into an unrecognizable municipal shape.
  Middle plate: OPERATIONAL SITE — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY — EFFECTIVE 05/02/2011. The seal is crisp. Different department name.
  Bottom placard, smaller, apologetic: FOLLOW POSTED INSTRUCTIONS AS APPLICABLE.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_04
  A phone number on the oldest plate has too few digits. It is printed confidently anyway.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_READ_01
  You track the dates with your thumb like they might line up if you press hard enough.
  They do not.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_READ_02
  The post remains unanimous about one thing: it will not be responsible.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_GOVERNS_01
  There is no answer posted.
  The post is an argument without a referee.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_GOVERNS_02
  The newer plate is mounted over the older one, but not centered, as if it wanted to be seen without touching responsibility.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_UPDATE_01
  Someone needed the word “OPERATIONAL” to exist here.
  Someone else needed “DECOMMISSIONED” not to disappear.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_UPDATE_02
  The bottom placard tries to split the difference, which is a form of optimism.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_INFORMAL_01
  You jot it down in neutral language that won’t start a war on its own.
  The post continues to look official in three directions at once.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_INFORMAL_02
  You can keep it informal, or you can make it someone’s problem on purpose.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_FORMAL_01
  You take the photo straight-on, then from the side to catch the bolt pattern.
  Your hands stay steady; your jaw doesn’t.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_FORMAL_02
  In your closure notes, you write it the way an auditor likes:
  COMPLIANCE CONFLICT: Site status signage inconsistent across posting authorities and effective dates. Requires resolution prior to closure sign-off.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_FORMAL_03
  You add a to-do: Resolve signage conflict (decommissioned vs operational).
  It feels like feeding a machine that runs on paper.
- SCN-004 / DG_SIGNPOST_CONFLICT / NARR_LEAVE_01
  You leave the signpost to continue being right in incompatible ways.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_START
  The guard shack sits off the approach road like it was placed by a committee that feared weather and people equally.
  The door has a steel pull handle. The card reader beside it glows faintly, as if embarrassed to be awake.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_LOOK_DOOR
  The door is closed flush. The latch side shows fresh wear where someone tested it recently and stopped.
  No gap, no give. It’s locked.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_LOOK_READER
  The reader’s indicator is on, but the light is thin and unstable, like it’s being rationed.
  A strip of tape under it reads: “TEMP POWER — DO NOT RELY.”
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_LOOK_TUBE
  A brass plate, scuffed to dull gold, sits beside a capped tube port.
  It’s labeled in block letters: “FORMS — INTAKE / OUTBOUND — DO NOT SEND FOOD.”
  Someone scratched an arrow under “OUTBOUND” like they didn’t trust the printed one.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_USE_READER_1
  You present your badge. The reader chirps once—polite, hopeful—then the light drops to a dim pulse.
  The lock doesn’t actuate.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_USE_READER_2
  A second later the reader resets itself, as if it can’t admit it tried.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALLBOX_1
  The speaker pops. A breath. Then a voice that sounds like it’s already composing an email about this.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALL_WAIT_1
  The speaker waits with the patience of a form.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALL_WAIT_2
  Static crackles, like someone shuffling papers.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALL_WAIT_3
  The call box hums, faintly pleased to be useful.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALL_WAIT_4
  The speaker clicks softly, as if it’s smiling.
- SCN-005 / SCN_005_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALL_END
  The line disconnects cleanly. You’re left with the door, the weak light, and a conversation that will outlive you in a folder.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N0
  The guard shack door has a handle that implies consent. The call box does not.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N1
  A label plate beneath the speaker is sun-faded: SECV — REMOTE ATTENDANCE.
- SCN-006 / DG_SCN_006_CALLBOX / N_NARR_COMMIT_1
  You have your next step: get marked onsite by Records— because the facility only recognizes people once it can file them.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N0_INTRO_A
  A riveted label plate sits beside the pneumatic tube intake—scratched clean where hands kept checking it long after the rest of the shack went quiet.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N1_INTRO_B
  Black enamel text, arrows, and department names. The plate looks more maintained than the door.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N3_LOOK_A
  The arrows form a clean loop, like someone wanted the order to be undeniable.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N3_LOOK_B
  “RECORDS ↔ SECURITY ↔ OPERATIONS” (labeled even if dead)
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N4_ASK_NARR
  The plate doesn’t answer. It does what signage always does here: insists someone once needed this to be true.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N5_TALK_A
  The call box speaker crackles as if it’s been waiting to be blamed.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N10_SHOW_PASS_A
  The call box has a slot for credentials. The slot is taped over with a strip that reads: “TEMPORARY — DO NOT MAKE PERMANENT.”
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N10_SHOW_PASS_B
  Even if you had the right token, access is still a story someone has to agree to.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N11_SHOW_FAIL_A
  The call box has a slot for credentials. The slot is taped over with a strip that reads: “TEMPORARY — DO NOT MAKE PERMANENT.”
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N11_SHOW_FAIL_B
  Requires: on-site authorization token / active Security presence.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N7_LOG_NARR_A
  You copy the routing exactly. Your pen hesitates on “SECURITY” like it might object.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N8_LOG_NARR_B
  The plate’s relationship goes into your paperwork as a procedural note, not a theory.
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N9_END_OUTCOME_NOTE
  Tube routing plate: RECORDS ↔ SECURITY ↔ OPERATIONS (labeled even if dead).
- SCN-007 / DG_TUBE_LABEL_PLATE / N20_LEAVE_A
  You step back from the plate. The arrows stay in your head like they’re part of the facility’s circulatory system, whether the tubes move or not.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N0
  The vestibule is a room designed to turn people into entries.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N1
  It smells like toner, old plastic, and a policy that outlived its staff.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N2
  Four fixtures remain, all of them confident: a badge insert dispenser, a desk drawer of old badges, a speaker/intercom, and a pneumatic tube port sealed with a cover plate.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DISP_0
  A clear acrylic dispenser, sun-yellowed at the edges.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DISP_1
  The inserts inside are blank—except for faint pre-print marks where a logo used to be. The bottom stack is slightly curled from heat, but still usable.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DISP_USE_1
  They slide out with the static cling of something that expects hands all day.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DISP_USE_2
  The facility doesn’t need your face. It needs a rectangle it recognizes.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DISP_LABEL_1
  A faded sticker: “TEMP BADGE INSERTS — PRINT FROM KIOSK / RECORDS AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED.” “Required” is underlined twice, as if the pen could enforce it.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_0
  The drawer resists, then gives—like it’s performing reluctance for the record.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_1
  Inside: old plastic badges, some cracked, some intact, each with an expired date and a format that repeats across decades.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_2
  There’s a stack of paper sign-in sheets under them—half used, then abandoned mid-week. Names, times, departments. A blank line waiting like a trap.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_EXAMINE_1
  The photos are irrelevant now—faces bleached to anonymity—but the structure isn’t.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_EXAMINE_2
  Site code. Employee/contractor checkbox. A “RECORDS STAMP” box. The important part is that someone once believed a stamp could make a person safe.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_EXAMINE_3
  You can work with this.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_TAKE_1
  You choose the least damaged badges—the ones that still look like they could be believed.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_TAKE_2
  The sign-in sheet tears free along a perforation, like it was designed to be removed quietly. This is not identity. This is props.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_HEADER_1
  “VISITOR / CONTRACTOR LOG — RECORDS COUNTER.”
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_HEADER_2
  A note in the margin: “If Records absent, tube form to Admin. If Admin absent, hold for morning.” Morning is not guaranteed.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_EXAMINE_AGAIN_1
  Same format, same faith in boxes and stamps. The structure is the artifact.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_DRAWER_TAKE_AGAIN_1
  You could take more. It wouldn’t change what’s missing: the authorization event.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_TUBE_0
  A pneumatic tube port, the kind that used to move decisions around faster than people.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_TUBE_1
  Someone has bolted a metal cover over it. The screws are mismatched, as if each one came from a different apology.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_TUBE_LOOK_1
  A paper routing chart is taped beside it, laminated, then cracked: “RECORDS → ADMIN → SECURITY (REMOTE)” with arrows that assume staffing like a religion.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_TUBE_LOOK_3
  The chart ends with a box: “IF UNSURE, FILE ANYWAY.”
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_TUBE_USE_1
  The screws turn a quarter rotation and stop—painted over.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_TUBE_USE_2
  It’s not sealed for safety. It’s sealed for finality, which is a different department.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_INTERCOM_0
  The speaker grille is clean in the center from repeated use.
- SCN-008 / DG_SCN_008_VESTIBULE / N_INTERCOM_1
  A label plate beneath it is sun-faded: SECV — REMOTE ATTENDANCE.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_START_1
  The badge insert dispenser is bolted to the wall at chest height.
  A laminated label above it reads: “VISITOR BADGE INSERTS — TAKE ONE.”
  The stack behind the plastic window looks intact in the way abandoned things look: untouched, not maintained.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_START_2
  A smaller sticker has been added later, slightly crooked: “EXPIRED STOCK NOT TO BE DISCARDED.”
  Someone underlined “NOT” hard enough to wrinkle the laminate.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_LABELS_1
  The main label is corporate-clean.
  The expiration notice is handwritten on tape: “KIOSK REJECTS WITHOUT INSERT.”
  The handwriting pauses on “rejects,” like it enjoyed writing it.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_LABELS_2
  Below, in smaller print: “Insert validity governed by issuance date.”
  That line is printed. The guilt is not.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_TEST_1
  You press the plastic tab.
  The mechanism gives with a soft, reluctant click—like it’s documenting your fingerprints.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_TEST_2
  One insert shifts forward into the slot, ready to be taken.
  The date stamp visible through the window is not recent.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_DRAWER_1
  The desk drawer sticks, then opens with a dry pop.
  Inside: old visitor badges, bent corners, faded photos, and inserts in plastic sleeves that have all gone cloudy.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_DRAWER_2
  A rubber band is wrapped around a small bundle labeled “TEMP — DO NOT SHRED.”
  The label is neat. The rubber band is not.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_OPEN_1
  The speaker grille is painted over. The button isn’t.
  When you press it, the line opens with a tone that sounds like a form being created.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_PRESENCE_2
  The line stays open, waiting for you to stop making it one thing by calling it another.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_PERSUADE_PASS_3
  The voice stops, like it just slid a document across a table and doesn’t want to watch you read it.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_INTERCOM_ENDCALL_1
  You release the button.
  The line closes cleanly, as if it never existed in the first place.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_TAKE_1
  You pull a single visitor badge insert from the dispenser.
  It’s expired, laminated, and perfectly usable in the way compliance hates: technically.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_TAKE_2
  The slot behind it advances the next insert forward, ready to pretend this is a normal day.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_TAKE_END
  Visitor badge insert acquired.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_END_LEAVE_DOWN
  You step back from the dispenser and head down toward the Guard Shack Exterior.
- SCN-009 / SCN009_BADGE_INSERT / N_END_LEAVE_RIGHT
  You leave the vestibule and move right toward the Admin Lobby and Kiosk.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_INTRO_1
  The guard shack vestibule smells like dust and toner. A desk sits under a dead intercom speaker like it’s waiting to be blamed. The drawer is labeled in block letters: RETIRED ACCESS MEDIA — DO NOT RE-ISSUE.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_INTRO_2
  You pull the drawer open. Old contractor badges lie in a shallow tray. Most are clipped to yellowing index cards. One badge has its magnetic stripe scored through, then taped over, then scored again—like someone argued with it in stages.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_INTRO_3
  A handwritten note on the tray: “These are not ‘active.’ Do not create new access events.” The quotation marks look defensive.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_LOOK_1
  Under the badges is a thin sign-out sheet titled CUSTODY (INFORMAL). Someone underlined “INFORMAL” so hard the paper’s almost cut.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_LOOK_2
  The entries are half names and full excuses: “TEMP—returning after calibration.” “Borrowed for audit photos (not use).” “Removed from circulation (pending decision).”
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_LOOK_3
  No one answers, because paper does not answer. It only persists. The demagnetized badge has a sticker: DO NOT DISCARD. Someone wrote over it: DO NOT PROCESS.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_USE_1
  The badge insert dispenser is an old slot with a faded instruction placard: INSERT — WAIT FOR GREEN — REMOVE. The word “GREEN” is circled twice, like reassurance didn’t take the first time.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_USE_2
  You feed the demagnetized badge into the slot. The machine pulls it in with polite certainty.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_USE_3
  [SFX] A small motor whirs. A beep tries to happen and stops halfway.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_USE_4
  The light stays stubbornly amber. The badge returns, slightly warmer, as if that helped.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_USE_5
  The dispenser prints a thin slip anyway: UNREADABLE — REFER TO SECURITY. The paper curls at the end like it’s embarrassed to exist.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_TALK_1
  The speaker grille is painted over, then scraped clean in a rectangle where a label used to be. A push-to-talk button has been replaced with a toggle switch that doesn’t commit to either position.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_TALK_2
  [INTERCOM VOICE] This line is monitored for safety and training. Not in real time. Which is not the same as “unmonitored,” just— manage your expectations.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_TALK_3
  [INTERCOM VOICE] Okay. So. Don’t use it. Using it creates an access attempt, which creates a question, which creates a file. We are not funded for additional files this quarter.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_TALK_4
  [INTERCOM VOICE] I can’t authorize that. I also can’t stop you. That’s a different form. If you take it, it becomes “in custody,” and then I have to ask whose custody, and then you’ll say your name, and then I’ll have to write it down, and then—
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_ASK_RESP_1
  [INTERCOM VOICE] Historically? Security. Practically? Nobody, because “nobody” can’t be subpoenaed. Formally? Facilities, but only when the facility is in an active state, and we are— we are “mothballed,” which is a status with feelings.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_ASK_RESP_2
  [INTERCOM VOICE] It is “unassigned.” Orphaned implies duty.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_ASK_RESTORE_1
  [INTERCOM VOICE] You don’t. You request a replacement through Admin, and Admin denies it because the site is in retirement posture, and then you cite operational necessity, and then Legal asks what operation, and then— If you mean physically, there’s a mag encoder in the admin kiosk area. It may or may not be “forbidden.” The sticker fell off years ago.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_ASK_RESTORE_2
  [INTERCOM VOICE] You did not “get it.” You acknowledged it. That’s safer for both of us.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_PERSUADE_2
  [INTERCOM VOICE] Chain-of-custody is a legal phrase. Please don’t say it like that. But— fine. If you insist on being correct: write your name on the informal sheet, do not date it, and take a photo of the drawer label. That way it’s “context,” not an “event.”
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_PERSUADE_3
  [INTERCOM VOICE] It is here. Please don’t make me be innovative about this.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_STOP_TALKING_1
  [INTERCOM VOICE] Appreciated. For the record— there is no record of appreciation.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_TAKE_1
  You take the demagnetized contractor badge. The tape on the stripe catches on your glove, reluctant to let go.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_TAKE_2
  The drawer suddenly looks emptier than it should, like you’ve changed the inventory by existing near it.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_CLOSE_1
  You push the drawer shut. It resists for a second, then seats with a soft clack like a stamp landing on the wrong form.
- SCN-010 / DG_SCN010_DRAWER_BADGES / N_CLOSE_2
  Nothing in the vestibule changes. Which is usually how the facility signals agreement.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_START
  Exterior ground service hatch. A steel lid with a lifting ring sits flush in cracked concrete.
  A short access ladder drops into a shallow utility pit.
  A service door waits at the bottom like it has been apologized to, repeatedly, in writing.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_ESTABLISH_TAGS
  Conduit runs disappear under the slab with fresh-ish tags. “MINIMUM BUILDING LOADS” is printed in a font that assumes you won’t argue.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_HATCH_1
  The ring is polished where gloves keep grabbing it. Someone has been here recently, and they were careful in the way people are careful when they want a record to show “normal wear.”
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_HATCH_2
  A stenciled note on the lid: “OPEN ONLY FOR AUTHORIZED SERVICE ACCESS.”
  Below it, a smaller sticker: “AUTHORIZED ≠ OPTIONAL.”
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_LADDER_1
  Galvanized rungs, clean enough to offend the surrounding concrete.
  A fall-arrest anchor is installed, tagged, and—this is the odd part—dated this quarter. That makes your jaw tighten, just a little.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_LADDER_2
  A laminated card hangs from the anchor: “DESCENT PROCEDURE: THREE POINTS OF CONTACT. DO NOT LINGER.”
  “Do not linger” is underlined twice, like it’s personal.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_DOOR_1
  You can’t see much from up here. The door is set into poured concrete at the bottom of the pit, painted “utility gray” over older layers.
  A placard reads: “SERVICE ACCESS — MINIMUM LOAD WAKE.”
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_DOOR_2
  The hinges look new. The knob looks old. That combination usually means a story nobody wants to tell twice.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_CONNECT_TOP
  Your handset finds a signal after a beat too long.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_LOG_PASS_TOP_2
  You hear typing. It sounds like a door closing, somewhere far away.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_END_TOP_3
  The line drops before you can decide whether that was advice or a disclaimer.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_OPEN_HATCH_1
  You hook the ring and pull. The lid gives with a small, practiced reluctance. Your shoulder complains on principle.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_OPEN_HATCH_2
  Cool air rises from below, smelling like damp concrete and electrical insulation. A maintained smell.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_STEP_BACK_1
  The lid settles back into place like it was never meant to be witnessed open.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_PIT_DESCEND_1
  You descend. Boots on rung, then rung, then the last drop onto a concrete pad. Your heart rate stays professional anyway.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_PIT_DESCEND_2
  The pit is shallow but deliberate: conduit runs in neat bundles, junctions labeled twice, and a small breaker box with a seal tag that looks newer than it should.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_PIT_DESCEND_3
  A plastic marker on the conduit reads: “SERVICE ACCESS / MINIMUM BUILDING LOADS.”
  Someone has underlined “MINIMUM” with a pen that ran out halfway through, like they changed their mind mid-emphasis.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_CONDUIT_1
  The labeling is consistent in the way a cover story is consistent.
  Feed lines: tagged. Return lines: tagged. A spare: tagged as “SPARE (DO NOT UTILIZE),” which is the kind of instruction that guarantees utilization.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_LOOK_CONDUIT_2
  One notice is taped crooked to the breaker box: “NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE NOTICES STORED INTERIOR.”
  The wording irritates you, because it’s not a category you can file yet.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_CONNECT_PIT
  Signal is better down here, which feels wrong.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CALL_END_PIT_3
  The call ends as if it was waiting for permission.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_CLIMB_UP_1
  You climb out. The light at the top is ordinary, and you resent it for that.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_DOOR_TEST_1
  You test the handle. The latch releases on the first try, like it’s been waiting to prove something.
- SCN-011 / DG_SCN_011_SERVICE_HATCH / N_DOOR_TEST_2
  Air spills through the gap—cooler, drier, with that faint ozone edge that means “powered,” but nobody will call it that out loud.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_START_01
  The exterior ground service hatch sits flush with the concrete, painted the color of old utility rooms.
  A lifting ring lies flat, as if it’s tired of being asked.
  A placard reads “AUX,” but the font doesn’t match anything else on site.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_START_02
  There’s a soft, intermittent click from below—like a relay testing its own patience.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_LOOK_01
  The hatch has been opened often, but never recently. The grime pattern is consistent with “routine” neglect.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_LOOK_02
  A peeling sticker on the rim says: “DO NOT RELABEL / TEMPORARY,” dated fourteen years ago.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_LOOK_03
  Someone hand-scribed a breaker map on laminated paper. Half the abbreviations are crossed out and rewritten in a different pen.
  You feel your teeth press together before you stop doing it.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_LOOK_04
  A second placard, newer, reads: “AUX POWER — NON-CRITICAL LOADS ONLY.”
  Below it, in smaller print: “Non-critical per Facilities, not per Operations.”
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_LOOK_05
  Nothing here is broken. It’s just been argued with.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_OPEN_01
  You hook a finger into the lifting ring and pull. The ring bites back before it lifts, like it resents being useful.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_OPEN_02
  The hatch seal releases with a wet pop.
  You pause a beat, because “inhaled mold” is a stupid way to become an incident.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_OPEN_03
  A short ladder descends into a service pocket. A conduit bundle runs down the wall, tied off with tape that has turned amber.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_CLOSE_01
  You set the hatch lid down and leave it as you found it. The lifting ring settles flat again, relieved.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_DOWN_01
  Below, the aux panel is exactly where it would be in a sane facility: left wall, waist height, with a deadfront that’s been removed and reinstalled too many times.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_DOWN_02
  The breaker labels disagree with the breaker map.
  You don’t argue with paper. You verify.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_DOWN_03
  You set your multimeter leads. The display steadies after a moment, as if it also prefers decisions to be documented.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_DOWN_04
  There’s available source, but the aux bus is not live.
  That’s good news in the boring way.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_TRACE_01
  You trace the conductors by tag and termination instead of by faith.
  Someone has re-terminated at least one run and kept the old label out of spite.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_TRACE_02
  A small charger cradle is mounted nearby—label maker model, familiar.
  The cradle’s indicator is dark.
  You feel an almost unreasonable irritation about that specific detail.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_BACK_OUT_01
  You climb back up and set the hatch lid down without latching it.
  The ring settles flat again, relieved.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_THROW_01
  You throw the breaker in one clean motion, because hesitation looks like doubt on a security camera.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_THROW_02
  A thin hum rises. Two indicator lamps wake in different colors, as if they can’t agree what success looks like.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_THROW_03
  A small ventilation fan starts somewhere behind the wall, not fast, just determined.
  The label maker cradle blinks, then holds steady: charging.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_THROW_06
  The panel stays steady. The facility doesn’t react.
  That almost feels like a relief, which is not a metric you can file.
- SCN-012 / DG_AUX_HATCH / N_LEAVE_01
  You step back from the hatch. The concrete is unchanged, which is its best feature.
  The relay clicking below continues, patient and unclaimed.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_START
  The card reader’s indicator is green now. The plastic faceplate is still scuffed like it remembers being hit.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_INTRO2
  A small display wakes up and immediately asks a question like it’s been waiting to be right.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_NARRATOR_SWIPE
  You swipe. The reader accepts the motion with a careful beep.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_USE_ENTER_DATE_NARR
  The keypad is membrane-soft. It feels like pressing on old office equipment that resents being asked to work.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_PRINT_CLICK_NARR1
  Something inside the housing clicks twice, like it’s double-checking it’s allowed to be helpful.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_PRINT_CLICK_NARR2
  A narrow slip feeds out into the tray.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_SLIP_LOOK_NARR
  The ink is sharp and official.
  
  TRAINING DATE REQUIRED.
  CONSULT RECORDS.
  
  The message is short enough to be reused indefinitely.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_SLIP_TAKE_NARR
  You pocket it for the binder. The reader goes idle without apologizing.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_RETRY_NARR
  You swipe again, because repetition is sometimes how systems admit you’re real.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_LOOK_READER_NARR
  The casing is municipal-standard. The screws are not.
  A small sticker says LAST CERTIFIED: [illegible], like someone didn’t want a year to be a promise.
  
  The display waits, patiently hostile.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_LOOK_TUBE_NARR
  A brass plate riveted to painted steel:
  “RECORDS / FORMS — OUTBOUND ONLY.”
  The arrow points toward the shack like that’s comforting.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_TALK_CALLBOX_NARR1
  The button depresses with a sticky, reluctant travel.
- SCN-013 / SCN_013_CARD_READER / N_WALK_AWAY_NARR
  The reader returns to its first demand, as if nothing here ever changed.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_START
  The admin lobby is arranged like the facility still expects the public.
  A kiosk hums in a way that suggests it has never once been thanked.
  On the wall: a laminated phone list, corners curled.
  Near the desk: a metal plaque, sun-faded, with an asset seal that refuses to die.
  The reception drawers sit slightly misaligned, like someone left in a hurry and then filed a memo about it.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PROMPT
  What do you check?
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_KIOSK_INTRO
  The kiosk screen is touch-sensitive in the way old glass pretends to be.
  A header reads: SPINDLE ADMIN SERVICES — LOBBY ACCESS.
  
  WELCOME.
  SELECT A SERVICE CATEGORY.
  UNAUTHORIZED USE IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_KIOSK_DIR
  DIRECTORY ACCESS IS LIMITED IN LOBBY MODE.
  SEARCH RETURNS TITLES ONLY.
  NAMES REQUIRE AUTHENTICATION.
  
  You try a simple keyword.
  
  RESULTS:
  — RECEPTION (UNSTAFFED)
  — RECEPTION OVERSIGHT (TEMPORARY)
  — RECEPTION — AFTER HOURS PROTOCOL
  
  Selecting a result requires authentication.
  It won’t give names. It will give vocabulary.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_KIOSK_WORK
  WORK ORDER SUBMISSION REQUIRES A SPONSOR ID.
  LOBBY MODE MAY PRINT STANDARD FORMS.
  SELECT: PRINT / CANCEL.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_KIOSK_PRINT_HEADER
  PRINTING: OLEA LEGACY ENERGY ASSETS — SPINDLE SITE
  FORM HEADER ONLY. NO ROUTING NUMBER ISSUED.
  
  A page feeds out: official letterhead, a site identifier line, and blank fields waiting to be lied into.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_KIOSK_INCIDENT
  TO REPORT A SAFETY CONDITION: LIFT HANDSET AT RECEPTION DESK.
  IF NO HANDSET IS PRESENT, COMPLETE FORM S-14 “CONDITION NOTICE.”
  DO NOT USE EMERGENCY CODES IN LOBBY MODE.
  
  LOBBY MODE IS NOT A CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.
  “EMERGENCY” IMPLIES AUTHORITY.
  AUTHORITY MUST BE VERIFIED.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_KIOSK_SHOW
  CREDENTIAL PRESENTED.
  CREDENTIAL NOT VERIFIED.
  LIMITATION ADJUSTED: LIMITED LOBBY MODE ENABLED.
  YOU MAY:
  — PRINT STANDARD HEADERS
  — VIEW TITLES AND EXTENSIONS
  — INITIATE A CALL REQUEST
  
  It doesn’t let you in. It does teach you what “in” is supposed to look like.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PHONE_INTRO
  The wall list is laminated over older laminated paper.
  Someone updated it by adding a sticker that has started to peel, like it’s trying to exit the organization.
  
  Extensions. Departments. Titles that sound like they were invented to move blame around.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PHONE_TOP
  You pick up the rhythm: short numbers for operations, longer for compliance, and a separate block labeled EXTERNAL LIAISONS as if the building is ashamed of them.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PHONE_OVERSIGHT
  The list offers safe-sounding titles: Temporary Oversight, Records Custodian (Acting), Facilities Liaison.
  None of them promise presence. All of them promise deniability.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PHONE_AFTERHOURS
  A boxed note: AFTER HOURS: DO NOT CONTACT SECURITY FOR ADMIN MATTERS.
  Under it, smaller: SECURITY WILL CONTACT YOU IF NECESSARY.
  It reads like a threat that was formatted by committee.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PLAQUE_INTRO
  The plaque is bolted to the wall like it’s holding the building’s identity in place.
  A corner is scuffed clean where someone’s hand must have worried it, again and again.
  
  The text is bureaucratic, not commemorative—meant to outlast argument.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PLAQUE_DESIGNATION
  S.P.I.N.D.L.E. — Spatial Power Inertial Node for Distributed Load Equalization.
  The acronym is confident. The expansion is defensive.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PLAQUE_OWNERSHIP
  An ownership chain rendered in tiny stamped text: municipal authority, then OLEA stewardship language, then a clause about “continued operation pending retirement.”
  It’s written like closure is a moral act.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_PLAQUE_TAG
  An asset ID is present, partially abraded, but still legible enough to cite.
  Next to it: a seal that implies someone once checked a box and thereby made the machine real.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_DRAWERS_INTRO
  The reception desk drawers resist at first, then slide like they’ve been waiting to be asked properly.
  The smell is paper, toner, and a faint sting of old adhesive.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_DRAWERS_TOP
  Forms. Carbon copies. A roll of VISITOR stickers that says TEMPORARY in cheerful red.
  A stamp pad so dry it feels like negligence.
  
  Not signed. Pre-signed—worse. A stack of letterhead with a printed name block and no signature, meant to be “efficient.”
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_DRAWERS_BOTTOM_1
  Old binders with tabs: ACCESS, ROUTING, INCIDENT.
  And a small metal stamp: RECEIVED — ADMIN LOBBY.
  Someone cared very deeply about when paper entered a room.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_DRAWERS_BOTTOM_2
  You pocket the stamp and a few blank headers.
  It’s not authority. It’s the costume authority wears.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_COMPILE_1
  You stand where the camera over the kiosk would have had the best view, back when anyone pretended to monitor it.
  Between the plaque’s wording, the phone list’s titles, and the kiosk’s “limited” print options, you have enough to sound inevitable.
- SCN-014 / DG_SCN_014_ADMIN_LOBBY / N_COMPILE_3
  You note the kiosk’s limitations, the extension structure, and the asset designation—three different kinds of legitimacy, all mutually incompatible.
  They will still work on the same people.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / INTRO_1
  The wall phone list is laminated and warped, like it’s been steamed by years of proximity to other people’s problems. Most entries are crossed out in pen that’s had time to become policy.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / INTRO_2
  A strip of newer tape sits over one column. The adhesive is still too clear to be old.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / LOOK_LEGAL_2
  You find it twice: once under “Counsel,” once under “Incident Containment (Administrative).” Same extension both times. Someone wanted it to survive edits.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / LOOK_LEGAL_3
  The Legal line is printed in a newer font than the rest. It’s the kind of update that says, quietly, “We will be consulted.”
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / LOOK_REST_1
  Facilities routes to a number with an asterisk and no explanation. Safety has three different extensions, each labeled “PRIMARY.”
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / LOOK_REST_2
  Procurement is listed under a department name that reads like a confession. The only entry that looks maintained is Legal.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / CALL_1
  The wall phone’s handset is slightly tacky in the way only public plastic gets. The dial tone arrives immediately, as if it’s been waiting to be useful.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / CALL_2
  The line connects with a click that sounds too modern for this building.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / CALL_3
  The message ends cleanly. No option to leave a voicemail. The extension, at least, is real.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / PRINT_1
  The lobby kiosk wakes with a fan noise that sounds irritated to be involved. Its screen offers a familiar OLEA header and an unfamiliar warning footer.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / PRINT_4
  Legal appears as the first suggestion, like it was already expecting to be attached.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / COMMIT_COPY_1
  You write the extension exactly as shown, including the prefix nobody uses anymore. Your handwriting stays neat on purpose.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / COMMIT_COPY_2
  You add the extension to your working contacts as an escalation channel and supervisor reference. It feels like writing down a fire exit you hope you don’t need.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / COMMIT_COPY_AFTER_CALL_1
  You record the extension as a usable escalation channel, exactly as Legal suggested: impersonal, citable, and hard to argue with later. The paper trail gets heavier, which is the point.
- SCN-015 / SCN015_WALL_PHONE_LIST / COMMIT_PRINT_1
  The kiosk prints a single strip of paper with the Legal extension and a timestamp. The font is official enough to be believed and cheap enough to be denied.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_INTRO
  The admin lobby smells like paper that gave up.
  A faded asset plaque hangs at shoulder height, half covered in contractor stickers that promise they were “temporary.”
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_LOOK_READ
  You tilt until the overhead lights stop reflecting.
  Most of the lettering is scuffed into bureaucracy: SERIAL, DIVISION, RESPONSIBLE PARTY—then a sticker blocks the one line that matters.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_PEEL_1
  The adhesive resists like it has a contract.
  A corner lifts, then another, and the sticker comes off in angry little flakes.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_PEEL_2
  Under it: an older sticker.
  Under that: marker ink that tried to become official.
  Under that: the original stamped handle, still clean where nobody’s touched it in years.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_REVEAL_SP01
  SP-01.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_DOUBLECHECK
  The plaque doesn’t clarify. It just sits there with the confidence of something that will outlast your audit cycle.
  “SP-01” is stamped deeper than the other text, which is usually how the “real” label behaves.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_OLEA_CONFIRM
  OLEA site handles, when they’re being consistent, follow a short prefix plus an ordinal.
  Consistency is the tell: this is the only thing on the plaque that looks like it was meant to be referenced in a form.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_SCAN_LABELS
  You scan the remaining stickers: vendor logos, a phone number with too many digits, a “Revised” date with no year.
  Nothing overrides the stamped handle. Nothing even tries.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_RECORDING
  You write it down exactly as stamped, because handwriting is where blame hides.
  The pen squeaks on the form like it objects to being useful.
  
  The plaque stays on the wall, looking newly exposed and vaguely offended.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_LEAVE_EARLY
  You leave the plaque where it is—half labeled, half forgotten, fully official either way.
- SCN-016 / DG_PLAQUE_SP01 / N_LEAVE_LATE
  You step back. The plaque returns to being background infrastructure, which is how most problems get to grow.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_START
  The reception desk is clean in the way abandoned things get when someone dusts around the idea of them.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_LABEL
  A brass label holder reads: “TEMPORARY.” The paper inside has browned into permanence.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_STICK
  The top drawer sticks, then gives with a soft complaint, like it’s documenting the force used.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_CONTENTS
  Inside: carbon-copy request forms, a stapler with no staples, and three pens that all died believing they were essential.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_ENVELOPE
  In the back corner, an envelope has been torn and re-taped enough times to become a laminate. Something small is caught in the seam—metallic, flat, with a faint pull when it slides past the stapler.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_PULL_OUT_RESIST
  You pinch the seam and work it free. It resists, then releases abruptly—your fingers go cold for a second from the metal.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_PULL_OUT_IDENT
  A small magnetic component. The kind that lives inside badge stripes and cheap cabinet latches.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_PULL_OUT_TEMP_FIX
  The envelope is stamped: “KIOSK ACCESS — TEMP FIX.” Someone underlined TEMP and then stopped believing in it.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_INSPECT_LIGHT
  You hold the piece up to the lobby light. It’s a thin magnet assembly with adhesive residue and a faint scuff pattern from a swipe path.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_INSPECT_BADGE
  Almost certainly badge hardware. “Almost” is how this building stays open.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_LOG_SHEET
  Under the forms is a half-sheet titled “REMOVALS / RETURNS.” It has six columns and one honest entry.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_LOG_SIGNATURE
  The signature line is blank. The date is not.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_LOG_NO_ONE
  No one did. The paper still insists it was a process.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_LOG_EXTRACT
  You extract the small magnetic component from the envelope seam.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_DOC_NOTE
  You tear the cleanest corner off a form and write a note with the least imaginative truth you can defend.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_DOC_TEXT
  “Recovered small magnet component from reception drawer; intended for access media continuity; to be logged upon network availability.” It reads like a person trying not to exist in court.
- SCN-017 / DG_RECEPTION_DRAWERS / N_CLOSE_NEAT
  You push the drawer back in. It closes too neatly, like it’s practiced at being ignored.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N001_INTRO
  The wall phone list is laminated, updated, and slightly curled at the corners like it’s been worried by too many careful hands. “OLEA — LEGAL (Work Orders / Waivers)” is circled in fading pen.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N003_DIALTONE
  The handset is heavier than it needs to be. The dial tone arrives with the patience of something that expects to be blamed later.
- SCN-018 / DG_SCN018_CALL_LEGAL / N004_PICKUP
  After three rings, someone answers without saying hello.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / NARR_INTRO
  The hallway smells like paper and warm dust.
  A door labeled RECORDS sits flush in a steel frame, the kind that assumes you’ll stop asking.
  To its right: a pneumatic tube station with a yellowed instruction card.
  Below a fire panel: a taped note with too many initials.
  A wall placard explains faxing like it’s hazardous waste.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / RECORDS_INTRO
  The Records door has two labels: one printed, one laminated over the top of it.
  The lock is newer than the paint.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / RECORDS_LOCKED
  You test the handle. No give.
  A red sticker on the jamb reads: CONTROLLED ACCESS — REQUEST THROUGH ADMIN INTAKE.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / RECORDS_KEYTAG
  A small metal tag under the handle answers without answering: KEY CUSTODY: FACILITIES / AFTER HOURS: SAFETY DESK.
  Both words look like they’ve been relabeled at least once.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / RECORDS_NO_RESPONSE
  There is no response mechanism on the door.
  It is a door that expects absence.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / RECORDS_LOCK_INSPECT
  The strike plate is polished from use.
  The screws are mismatched—someone serviced it in a hurry and wanted that fact to be deniable.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / RECORDS_OLEA_DENIED
  There’s no intercom to receive authority. Only the sticker.
  The laminated overlay adds a second line, smaller font: NO VERBAL APPROVALS. SUBMIT ROUTING.
  Someone has underlined “NO” hard enough to dent the plastic.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / RECORDS_INTAKE_STICKER
  A second sticker, half-hidden by the first, reads: RECORDS INTAKE VIA PNEUMATIC OR FAX — DO NOT SLIDE UNDER DOOR.
  “DO NOT” is in a different handwriting, as if that was the real emergency.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / TUBE_INTRO
  The tube station is labeled ADMIN INTAKE / RECORDS ROUTING.
  It has a round hatch, a slot for a canister, and a tiny window that shows nothing.
  A green pilot light glows steadily.
  A tiny label beneath it insists: INDICATOR DOES NOT CONFIRM DESTINATION.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / TUBE_HATCH
  The hatch releases with a dry click.
  Inside is an empty canister cradle and a stale draft, like the building exhaled through a straw.
  A handwritten note inside the hatch says: CANISTERS HELD IN COPY/FAX. SIGN OUT.
  The handwriting is neat in a way that implies consequences.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / TUBE_CARD
  The card is laminated. The lamination is cracking from age, not use.
  It lists destinations as if they’re people:
  A — ADMIN INTAKE (FOR ROUTING)
  R — RECORDS (DELIVERY ONLY)
  S — SAFETY DESK (EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS)
  A final line, smaller: DO NOT SEND ORIGINALS YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO LOSE.
  “Lose” is underlined once, then again.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / TUBE_REQUEST
  The station does not answer.
  The card does, indirectly: ADMIN INTAKE (FOR ROUTING) is the only item with parentheses, like it’s the only one allowed to make decisions.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / TUBE_WHERE
  The only reply is the warning label: INDICATOR DOES NOT CONFIRM DESTINATION.
  Whoever wrote that had been blamed for physics.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / FIRE_INTRO
  A note is taped below the fire panel with three layers of tape, as if one layer would be an admission.
  The printed header says FIRE RESPONSE QUICK REFERENCE.
  The note is mostly phone numbers and forbidden verbs:
  - DO NOT RESET PANEL (unless instructed)
  - DO NOT ANNOUNCE “INCIDENT” (use “irregular condition”)
  - IF RECORDS ACCESS REQUIRED: notify SAFETY DESK first “for chain,” then Admin Intake “for routing.”
  At the bottom: If asked why, cite “closure compliance.” Do not elaborate.
  Someone added a tiny checkbox: I did not elaborate.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / FIRE_WHY
  The note doesn’t justify itself. It just instructs.
  The tape has a fingerprint pressed into it, like someone paused there and decided to comply.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / FIRE_CHAIN
  The note is careful: “for chain” is not the same as approval.
  It’s a promise your request will be owned by multiple people, briefly, so none of them owns it later.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / FAX_INTRO
  A placard reads: FAX SUBMISSIONS — COMPLIANCE ACCEPTED FORMAT.
  It’s mounted with screws that don’t match. That feels deliberate.
  It lists requirements with the tone of a threat:
  - Cover sheet must include: SITE ID, DATE, SENDER NAME, PURPOSE (ONE WORD)
  - Do not use “urgent.” Use “time-bound.”
  - If pages are missing, resubmit entire packet.
  A final line: FAX CONFIRMATION IS NOT RECEIPT.
  Someone has circled “NOT” and drawn a little arrow to nothing.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / FAX_PURPOSE
  A pen mark in the margin suggests approved options: CLOSURE. INVENTORY. ROUTING.
  “ROUTING” is underlined like it gets you out of explaining yourself.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / FAX_RECORDS
  In smaller print: RECORDS REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA ADMIN INTAKE.
  Under it, a handwritten addition: FAX OK IF TUBE DOWN.
  The handwriting looks annoyed, like the tube being down was taken personally.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / COMMIT_NARR1
  You have enough to say, later, that you tried the obvious door first.
  The hallway offers two acceptable alternatives: send the request like cargo, or escalate it like smoke.
  Neither requires anyone to admit they gave you access.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / COMMIT_NARR2
  The pilot light on the tube station stays steady, indifferent, as if it’s already filed you.
- SCN-019 / DG_SCN019_RECORDS_HALLWAY / COMMIT_NARR3
  You step back before the building can interpret that as agreement.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_START_1
  The pneumatic tube station hums like it’s resentful about being ignored.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_START_2
  The outgoing slot sits a few millimeters open. Something metallic is caught in the felt.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_START_3
  A key ring—cheap steel. A strip of masking tape wrapped around it, hand-labeled: TEMPORARY.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_LOOK_1
  Three keys, two blanks, and one plastic fob with a fading barcode.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_LOOK_2
  Someone punched the tag numbers hard enough to tear the paper—like they wanted the numbers to survive blame.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_LOOK_3
  A placard above the slot reads: “TUBE VARIANCE IS NORMAL. ALL TRANSFERS ARE NON‑CUSTODIAL UNTIL SIGNED.” The word “signed” is underlined twice.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_ASK_1
  Your voice goes into the hallway and comes back as air-conditioning.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_ASK_2
  A smaller sticker on the side: “FOR DISCREPANCIES, CONTACT RECORDS INTAKE.” The listed extension is smudged out, carefully, like a correction made to avoid creating a new problem.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_TALK_2
  The sentence is engineered to be true no matter what happens next. You can almost hear Legal clearing its throat.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_LOGONLY_1
  You rehearse the phrase you’ll use later: custody correction. It feels sturdier than the truth.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_USE_1
  You pull the ring free. The felt resists, then gives up with a tiny sigh, like it’s relieved you’re the one touching it.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_USE_2
  The tape label—TEMPORARY—sticks to your glove. The adhesive is fresh enough to be intentional, not archival.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_USE_3
  This expands what you can open without anyone ever authorizing access in a sentence that can be quoted later.
- SCN-020 / DG_TUBE_TEMP_KEYS / N_USE_LOG_2
  You don’t have a form for “found in tube station,” so you’ll call it a custody correction if anyone asks. It will be easier to defend than the truth.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_ENTRY
  The Copy and Fax Room smells like warm plastic and old approvals.
  A copier hums as if it’s being paid by the minute.
  On the wall: a service-code sticker stack, layered like sediment.
  A fax machine displays LOW TONER with the confidence of a verdict.
  A shelf of binder supplies sits within reach, technically.
  
  Hotspots: Copier control panel. Service code sticker stack. Fax machine tray. Binder supplies shelf.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_COPIER_INTRO
  The copier screen is bright, polite, and locked.
  It offers options it won’t let you touch.
  
  On-screen: USER COPY (disabled). SERVICE FUNCTIONS (requires code). PRINT STATUS (empty queue).
  A tiny camera lens watches your hands like it’s documenting intent.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_COPIER_0000
  The copier accepts the digits, pauses, then rejects them with a tone that sounds trained.
  
  INVALID CODE. CONTACT AUTHORIZED SERVICE.
  
  The screen stays friendly. It does not become helpful.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_COPIER_1234
  INVALID CODE.
  The copier prints nothing, but you still feel judged.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_COPIER_DATE
  The copier rejects it faster, like it’s tired of this game.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_COPIER_DISABLED
  The copier does not answer.
  A small label under the screen does: PROPERTY OF FACILITY SUPPORT. UNAUTHORIZED COPYING PROHIBITED.
  The label is newer than the dust around it.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_COPIER_HINTS
  In the corner: a faded vendor logo, half-scraped away.
  Under it, a blank line where a phone number used to be—peeled off, then re-stickered, then peeled again.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_STICKERS_INTRO
  A column of stickers climbs the wall beside the copier.
  Every sticker claims it is the last sticker anyone will ever need.
  
  Top layer: DO NOT SHARE SERVICE CODE.
  Under it: a different DO NOT SHARE SERVICE CODE, from a company that no longer exists.
  A phone number is visible, then not, depending on the angle.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_STICKERS_PEEL
  The adhesive resists, then gives up in a way that feels personal.
  Underneath: a handwritten code, smudged, as if the wall tried to forget it.
  
  You can make out a 4-digit service code.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_COPIER_UNLOCKED
  The copier accepts the code without gratitude.
  SERVICE FUNCTIONS unlock.
  
  A menu appears: CALIBRATION. MAINTENANCE LOG. CONSUMABLES OVERRIDE. PRINT TEST PAGE.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_STICKERS_MORE
  Another sticker layer comes loose.
  Under it: a vendor name, then a different vendor name, then a different one again—each one insisting it is not responsible for anything outside “standard operation.”
  
  The service number repeats across three eras, like a dare.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_STICKERS_COMPARE
  You line up torn edges and half-letters.
  It’s less like reading, more like reconstructing an alibi.
  
  You recover a 4-digit service code.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_STICKERS_WHO
  No names, only layers.
  Whoever it was, they left instructions designed to outlive them.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_VM_RING
  The line rings once, like it already knows you’re there.
  Then a voicemail answers, bright and pre-defensive.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_VM_AFTER
  The voicemail hangs up first, like a practiced skill.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_FAX_INTRO
  The fax machine tray holds a single curled page: a transmission report with no recipient.
  The machine’s display reads LOW TONER, as if toner is a moral resource.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_FAX_READ
  The report lists: DATE, TIME, RESULT, and a blank where a number should be.
  RESULT: FAILED — TONER INSUFFICIENT FOR CONFIRMATION.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_FAX_TEST
  You feed a sheet into the slot.
  The machine grips it with quiet commitment.
  
  It dials nothing, waits, then prints a report anyway—faint, half-legible.
  
  FAILED — TONER LOW. CONFIRMATION REQUIRED.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_FAX_WHY
  The fax machine does not answer.
  The printed report does: CONFIRMATION IS PART OF TRANSMISSION.
  The machine is not interested in outcomes. Only artifacts.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_FAX_CONFIRM
  The fax can generate time-stamped confirmations and header lines—when it has toner.
  It is, unfortunately, correct about that.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_SHELF_INTRO
  A metal shelf labeled DOCUMENT ASSEMBLY.
  The label is crisp; the supplies look rationed.
  
  Visible: empty binder spines, tab dividers, a hole punch with a bent handle, label tape, and sealed toner boxes.
  A small plastic latch is tagged INVENTORY CONTROL — DO NOT SELF-ISSUE, which feels targeted.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_SHELF_INVENTORY
  You take stock: binder covers, rings, tabs, hole punch, label tape, and toner.
  Enough to manufacture legitimacy, assuming the machines cooperate.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_SHELF_LATCH
  The latch does not open.
  It isn’t strong. It’s principled.
  
  A tag dangles: RELEASE REQUIRES ISSUE LOG ENTRY.
  The issue log is a clipboard that is missing by policy.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_SHELF_MIN
  The shelf has everything except permission.
  Which, historically, is the hardest component to source.
  
  You can already see the binder’s bones: tabs, covers, labels, and toner to make it all look intentional.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_SHELF_OLEA_NARR
  You say it like you’ve said it into worse rooms.
  The latch doesn’t respect you, but it does respect the phrase.
  
  It clicks open.
  
  Inside: toner cartridges, fresh tab sets, and a sealed minimum-capacity binder.
  The room is now, unavoidably, a binder workstation.
- SCN-021 / DG_SCN021_COPY_FAX_ROOM / N_DISCOVER_WRAP
  You’ve identified the machinery and supplies needed to assemble the minimum closure binder:
  copier access, toner, confirmation-print capability, and physical binder materials.
  
  You do not assemble anything yet.
  You just learn what you can prove.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N001_INTRO
  The Copy and Fax Room smells like hot plastic and old staples. The fax machine is idle in the way a machine looks idle when it’s still warm.
  
  In the tray: a curled, half-fed printout. Legal’s Work Order, rendered in exhausted ink—half text, half ghosts.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N020_PULL
  The top page is a Work Order template—half text, half afterimage.
  
  The signature block is present. The scope paragraph is not.
  
  It’s enough to start an argument, not enough to end one.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N030_HEADER
  The header line prints in blocky, exhausted characters:
  
  ROUTE: OLEA LEGAL — OUTBOUND / DEST: FACILITY FAX (POSTED)
  REF: WO-RET-SP01
  
  The timestamp is five minutes ago. The machine is still warm, like it wants credit.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N101_FIRST_RESULTS
  The fax machine wakes up with a complaint disguised as a motor.
  
  Page one prints crisp at the top and dissolves in the middle.
  Page two prints the middle perfectly and sacrifices the asset line to a smear.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N121_AGAIN_RESULTS
  The machine tries a new failure mode—this time the header line is perfect and the signature is a bruise.
  
  Legal’s name is readable, but the pen stroke looks like it was done while bracing for impact.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N140_PATCHWORK
  You lay the pages out, selecting sentences like you’re building a body from acceptable parts.
  
  What you end up with reads like a fence built out of clauses:
  
  “WORK ORDER — RETIREMENT SUPPORT (NARROW PURPOSE)”
  “ASSET: SP-01 (as labeled on site)”
  “SCOPE: Closure-support activities limited to verification and documentation steps listed on the standard retirement checklist.”
  “EXCLUSIONS: No exploratory testing. No evaluation of anomalous conditions. No language implying ‘authorization to enter.’”
  “THIS INSTRUMENT CONFIRMS TASK DESCRIPTION ONLY. It does not certify site condition, personnel training, or safety baseline.”
  
  The last line is underlined twice, like someone pressed too hard.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N205_SERVICE_MODE_NARR
  The sticker peels reluctantly, like it was saving itself for an emergency that mattered.
  
  You key in a code that should not be common knowledge. The machine accepts it without comment, which is its own kind of comment.
  
  The next print is darker. The words stop trying to disappear.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N220_READ_SCOPE
  The scope language is narrow enough to fit through a mail slot.
  
  Every helpful noun is paired with an unhelpful disclaimer, like Legal is stapling you to the document at a safe distance.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N201_SERVICE_FAIL
  You reach for the “right numbers” and come up short.
  
  Either you don’t have the sticker, or you don’t have the procedure down clean enough to risk it. The machine keeps its bland, default contrast—perfect for receipts, terrible for liability.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N160_SUCCESS_PRINT
  On the next passes, the printer finally commits to the idea of ink.
  
  You end up with two legible Work Order pages, duplicated, edges still warm. They agree with each other—an institutional miracle.
  
  The machine keeps its faint mechanical hum for a second longer than necessary, as if waiting for you to ask it to certify something.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N911_END_BAD_COPY
  You fold the pages anyway. The fold goes through the only readable sentence.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N920_END_GOOD_ENOUGH
  You can already hear an auditor saying “good enough” like it’s profanity.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N930_END_PATCHWORK
  You keep the best of the damage. The binder will have to forgive you.
- SCN-022 / DG_SCN022_FAX_TRAY_WORK_ORDER / N940_END_ONE_SET
  You fold it carefully, avoiding the clean paragraph like it’s a wound. One set isn’t a binder. It’s a promise you haven’t backed up yet.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_INTRO
  The copier control panel is awake in the way old office machines are awake: lights on, no help offered.
  A prompt waits for a service code.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_STICKER_STACK_NOTICE
  A stack of “SERVICE UPDATE” stickers sits beside the panel. The top sticker is newer, too clean, and placed with intent.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_LAYERED_STICKER
  The sticker is layered. You can see an older edge under it, like a scab someone didn’t want picked.
  The top layer reads: “CODE RELOCATED — SEE ADMIN.” No admin. No note. Just adhesive.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_STICKER_NO_ANSWER
  The sticker does not answer.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_GATE_NO_TAG
  You can remove it, physically. You cannot remove it, institutionally.
  Without a temporary lift tag, it reads as vandalism no matter how careful you are.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_DEFAULT_CODES_FAIL
  You enter the usual suspects. The panel rejects each one with the same polite tone.
  The last beep sounds faintly judgmental.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_LABEL_MAKER_READY
  The label maker is charged. The tape cartridge is half-full, which feels like a dare.
  The screen blinks: ENTER TEXT.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_PRINTED_TEMP_LIFT
  The label prints with a slow mechanical confidence. The letters are crisp, almost smug.
  You now have a tag that looks like permission.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_PRINTED_VOID
  The label prints: VOID. It’s extremely official-looking for something with no authority.
  It will not solve the locked copier.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_PUT_DOWN_LABEL_MAKER
  You set it back. The label maker’s screen goes dark like it’s offended.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_APPLY_TAG_BRIDGE
  You place the “TEMPORARY LIFT” tag so it bridges sticker to panel, like a tiny legal hypothesis.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_PEEL_REVEAL_CODE
  Then you peel the top layer. Under it: the original service code, printed in fading block text.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_ENTER_CODE_READY
  You enter the code. The copier accepts it immediately, as if it was never meant to be a secret.
  The screen changes to READY.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_TONER_AND_DECISIONS
  The machine warms up. The room smells faintly of hot toner and old decisions.
- SCN-023 / DG_SCN023_COPIER_SERVICE_CODE / NARR_BACK_AWAY
  You step back into the room’s quiet. The fax tray sits untouched. Binder supplies wait in straight lines.
  The copier remains locked, which is a kind of order.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_INTRO_01
  Copy and Fax Room. Fluorescents that don’t flicker so much as hesitate.
  A metal shelf labeled: BINDER SUPPLIES — TAKE ONE (1). Someone added “PER CATEGORY” in pen, then crossed it out, then underlined it.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_INTRO_02
  A half-empty row of 3-ring binders. Divider tabs. Sheet protectors. A stapler that looks personally offended by misuse.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_INV_01
  Binders: assorted, mostly intact.
  Tabs: A–Z, 1–12, and a set labeled “MISC” like it’s a destination.
  Sheet protectors: cloudy, but legal enough.
  Fasteners: brads, clips, and one bag of zip ties that should not be here.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_OVERBUILD_01
  You could add: cover sheet, revision log, tab color standard, and a contents page that implies a universe where contents stop changing.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_OVERBUILD_02
  You step back before you start optimizing for an auditor that isn’t physically here.
  The shelf waits, patient, like it gets paid by the hour.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_EQUIP_01
  The copier control panel is smeared with fingerprints and good intentions.
  A stack of service code stickers sits like contraband pretending to be office supplies.
  The fax tray holds curled paper that looks resentful.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_EQUIP_COPIER_01
  It whirs, then pauses, then whirs again.
  The screen reads: READY. Not “able.” Not “functional.” READY.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_EQUIP_STICKERS_01
  Tiny numbers. Tiny adhesive squares. A whole taxonomy of access.
  You don’t pocket them. You don’t need that kind of story later.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_EQUIP_FAX_01
  The top page is a transmission confirmation from years ago.
  It confirms nothing except that someone once believed paper could arrive somewhere safe.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_INTRO_01
  You pull a binder. It creaks the way old plastic does when it remembers budgets.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_MINIMUM_01
  Minimum means: it closes, it indexes, and it answers obvious questions before someone asks them out loud.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_WORKORDER_01
  You slide the work order behind a protector. The sheet catches on the corner, like it’s trying to be important.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_CHECKLIST_01
  Checklist goes in front. Not because it’s first, but because it’s seen first.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_SIGNOFF_01
  Signature line stays blank. It always does at this stage. You keep your pen capped anyway.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_CODES_01
  You don’t write the codes on the binder. You don’t “store” them.
  You include them, temporarily, in a sealed envelope, because words matter when blame is looking for handles.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_TABS_01
  You pick tabs that won’t start a fight: WORK ORDER, CHECKLIST, CODES, NOTES.
  “NOTES” is where uncertainty goes to become someone else’s problem.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_MISSING_01
  You are missing: a current facility map, an asset registry addendum, and any page that says the site is normal in a way anyone would agree with.
  You can compensate for two of those. The third is not a document problem.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_CHAIN_01
  You tuck in a chain-of-custody form you hope you won’t need.
  The paper is too clean. That’s the tell.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_OLEA_ATTEST_01
  You find an OLEA internal template sheet: FIELD PRESENCE ATTESTATION — NON-INTERPRETIVE.
  You add it behind the checklist. The language is aggressively modest. It does not describe anomalies. It describes attendance.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_GENERIC_ATTEST_01
  There’s no authorized template for you. Only a blank page and the temptation to invent one.
  You do not.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_ASM_LEAVE_01
  You step back. The shelf stays put. Policy does, too.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_COMMIT_01
  You press the rings shut. They click with the confidence of cheap hardware pretending it’s policy.
  The binder is now functional: indexed, legible, and annoying to dispute.
  The shelf label still says TAKE ONE (1). You take none of its advice.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_EXIT_LEFT_01
  Left: Records Hallway and Tube Station. The air changes like you crossed into another department’s expectations.
- SCN-024 / DG_BINDER_SUPPLIES_MINIMUM / N_EXIT_DOWN_01
  Down: Non-Local Compliance Notices Room. The signage is too careful, which is its own kind of warning.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / N_START
  The lobby kiosk terminal hums with the confidence of something that has never been wrong on paper.
  A green header reads: “PRESENCE FILING / STAFFING COMPLIANCE.”
  Below it: “UNFILED INDIVIDUAL DETECTED.”
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / N_READER_WAIT
  The reader’s red light waits, patiently accusing—then softens to green as the kiosk concedes you exist enough to be counted.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / N_PRINTER_BEAT
  The kiosk’s printer stutters, like it resents committing to a timeline.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / END_SUCCESS_TPR
  A warm strip of paper slides out: TEMPORARY PRESENCE RECEIPT.
  The kiosk quietly updates its count as if you have always been here.
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / END_FAIL_NOT_FILED
  The kiosk displays: “PRESENCE NOT FILED.”
  Under it, in smaller text: “Non-filed individuals are not in violation. They are simply unhelpful.”
- SCN-025 / SCN025_KIOSK_PRESENCE / END_CANCEL
  You step away from the kiosk. It continues to glow, ready to file anyone who can be made legible.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N0
  The guard shack sits where it has always sat: between the road and the liability.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N1
  The door has a handle that implies consent. The reader has a light that implies recognition. Neither implies you.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_VEST_LOCKED_1
  You step to the threshold that would become the vestibule. The door remains closed, as if the building is waiting for a database to approve your legs.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_DOOR_1
  The handle turns with bureaucratic optimism.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_DOOR_2
  The latch does not. The door remains closed as a policy statement.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_READER_1
  You present what the system would have accepted in a staffed decade.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_READER_2
  The reader blinks once—an acknowledgement without obligation—then returns to its default: waiting for a person who exists in the correct place.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_TUBE_1
  A metal plate riveted under the tube label: ROUTING / AUTHORIZATION.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_TUBE_2
  Someone has scratched a single word into it with a key: “RECORDS.” It’s not instructions. It’s blame allocation.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALLBOX_0
  The speaker grille is polished in the center from repeated requests.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_CALLBOX_1
  A label plate beneath it is sun-faded: SECV — REMOTE ATTENDANCE.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_COMMIT_1
  The call box speaker emits the soft hiss of distance and servers.
- SCN-026 / DG_SCN_026_GUARD_SHACK_EXTERIOR / N_COMMIT_5
  A relay clicks somewhere behind the door. The reader light changes its mind for a moment.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_ENTER
  The conference room is empty in the way a room gets empty when someone has already finished being here.
  A printer tray holds a single sheet, still warm at the corners.
  A checklist binder sits open to a tab labeled “FINAL SIGN-OFF.”
  On the whiteboard: three bullet points under COMPARABILITY, underlined twice.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_LOOK_TRAY
  A pre-stamped form: EAC FINDING SLIP.
  Recipient: Field Systems Specialist (Closure).
  Status: OPEN.
  Blocker: Final sign-off prohibited until one of the following attachments is provided:
  - Incident page (site event narrative)
  - Waiver (risk acceptance)
  - No-anomaly test printout from Operations
  Someone has checked “Comparability required” in careful penmanship. It feels personal, which is worse.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_LOOK_TRAY_QUOTE
  At the bottom, a typed note reads like it expects to be quoted aloud.
  
  “I'm not saying the site is unsafe.
  I'm saying the record is not comparable.”
  —EAC Senior Assurance Liaison
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_LOOK_CHECKLIST
  The closure checklist is intact until the last page.
  A yellow sticky flag marks a line item: EAC Finding Resolution Attachment — REQUIRED.
  The paper smells like copier toner and someone else’s confidence.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_LOOK_CHECKLIST_MARGIN
  In the margin, in tidy handwriting: “If it can’t be categorized, it can’t be closed.”
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_LOOK_WHITEBOARD
  Under COMPARABILITY:
  - “Unexpected reflective behavior” (circled)
  - “Near-miss, personnel” (question mark)
  - “Equipment drift / calibration anomaly” (underlined)
  Someone has added: “Do not use novel terms in the finding summary.”
  The marker squeaked hard on that line, like it mattered.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_TALK_OPEN
  There’s no one to answer.
  But the Finding Slip has a “Liaison Notes” section, written in a voice that expects compliance.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_LOOPBACK_TRAY
  The slip sits in the tray, perfectly patient.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_ASK_AUTH_TAG
  The checklist binder remains open to the last page, like it’s waiting for your signature to become a mistake.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_DEFER_TAG
  Even in “accommodation,” the framework keeps its teeth.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_DEFER_FAIL_TAG
  The slip remains where it is, as if it never asked permission.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_TAKE_SLIP
  You lift the sheet from the tray. The toner hasn’t fully set; your thumb smudges the word OPEN.
  The checklist binder accepts it like it was missing a tooth.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_TAKE_SUMMARY
  EAC Finding Slip added to inventory.
  Objective added: Resolve EAC Finding.
  Final sign-off will be blocked until you attach: an incident page, a waiver, or a no-anomaly test printout from Operations.
- SCN-027 / EAC_FINDING_INTRO / NARR_LEAVE
  You step back into the hallway.
  The conference room stays behind you, holding its paperwork at the ready, like it knows you’ll be back.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_ENTER
  The Non-Local Compliance Notices Room is smaller than it should be for how much paper it holds.
  Forms racks sag under standardized templates. An envelope stack sits like it’s waiting for hands that never arrive.
  One notice is clipped higher than the rest. Its barcode is too clean. Too high-contrast. Like it was printed by a different decade.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_FORMS_INTRO
  The rack is labeled in local terms—Retention, Posting, Public Notice—then abruptly switches to templates that assume different laws.
  The phrasing is tight, standardized, and defensive in the way only a distant office can manage.
  
  A few headers repeat across unrelated forms:
  “Standing Indicator.”
  “Service Class.”
  “Queue Position.”
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_STANDING_EXPLAIN
  There’s no one here to answer.
  The template defines it anyway, in a footnote that sounds like it was written after an argument:
  “Standing: the condition of recognized eligibility to be processed.”
  The word “processed” is underlined once, then copied imperfectly.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_FORMS_SKIM
  You skim until the sentences stop being local. Then you stop.
  The forms go back into the rack like they were never out.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_ENVELOPES_INTRO
  Pre-addressed envelopes. Windowed. Uniform weight.
  Most are stamped with the same bland routing marks, like they’ve been approved for travel through a system you don’t see.
  
  A few have the same too-clean barcode format as the clipped notice.
  They’re not sealed with glue. They’re sealed with a pressure strip that assumes speed.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_POCKET_ENVELOPE_LINE
  You take one without ceremony.
  It feels like taking a blank form: harmless, until someone decides it wasn’t.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_LEAVE_ENVELOPES_LINE
  You don’t touch them.
  Paper has a way of becoming your responsibility through fingerprints alone.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_NOTICE_INTRO
  The notice is a standardized compliance posting.
  It uses local nouns—facility, operator, responsible party—but the verbs are wrong.
  Not “must comply.” More like “will be held.”
  
  The barcode is the part that doesn’t match anything else in the room.
  It’s too precise. No smearing. No aging. Like it arrived already archived.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_NOTICE_BODY
  You read the first lines twice because they’re trying not to be accusatory.
  
  “NOTICE: Non-local compliance condition detected.”
  “Action: Hold state pending documentation.”
  “Reference: [redacted by copy quality].”
  
  A line at the bottom repeats like a disclaimer that got promoted:
  “Incorrect service class assignments may affect standing.”
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_NOTICE_SCAN
  The scanner is older than the barcode.
  You feed the edge under the glass anyway, because “unreadable” is a category you know how to report.
  
  The scanner chirps once—unhelpfully confident—then prints a stub of metadata:
  “FORMAT: NON-LOCAL”
  “ROUTING: EXTERNAL”
  “STATUS: HELD”
  The rest is blank, as if the machine refuses to pretend.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_FILE_ORDINARY_LINE
  You register the barcode as “unfamiliar,” and then you demote it to “not today.”
  That’s a professional skill, most days.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_FILE_ORDINARY_SCAN_LINE
  You treat the stub like a curiosity, not a warning.
  The notice stays clipped. The room stays quiet.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_OUTRO_BEAT
  You notice it. You don’t understand it.
  You will later wish those were different actions.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_LEAVE_LOBBY_LINE
  You leave the notices where they are, performing compliance by not touching it.
  The door shuts with the soft finality of an office that expects paper to outlive people.
- SCN-028 / SCN028_NON_LOCAL_NOTICES / N_LEAVE_COPYFAX_LINE
  You step out toward the machines that turn originals into liabilities.
  Behind you, the clipped notice stays perfectly legible, like it’s been waiting to be recognized.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_START
  Non-Local Compliance Notices Room. A fluorescent hum, a stale paper smell, and a rack of templates that don’t quite belong anywhere.
  A notice on the wall carries a barcode format you don’t recognize. It’s been carefully re-taped, like that fixes the jurisdiction.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_OVERVIEW
  Three hotspots compete for your attention: a forms rack labeled “MISFITS / DO NOT DISCARD,” an unsealed envelope stack, and the barcode notice with unfamiliar striping.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_FORMS_DESC
  The rack holds templates that failed to integrate into local policy. The tabs are color-coded with the confidence of someone who’s never had to defend them.
  One folder is labeled: “TRAINING WAIVER — FIELD PRESENCE / LIABILITY LIMITATION.”
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_WAIVER_CLOSER
  The language is clean, aggressive, and oddly comforting. It doesn’t say you’re safe. It says everyone agreed on what “safe” means, which is usually the part that survives.
  A footer reads: “Non-local equivalency accepted where local training is unavailable.” The word “equivalency” is underlined twice.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_ASK_EQUIVALENCY
  There’s no author, no department code, just a revision history that keeps renaming itself. The most recent revision is “R5: Comparable Instruction Standard.”
  You can almost hear an auditor insisting that a thing can be true if it’s comparable to something else.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_ASK_MISFITS
  Someone wrote in pen: “VALID BUT NOT OURS.” Then crossed out “ours” and wrote “LOCAL.”
  Beneath it, in smaller handwriting: “Do not cite origin unless asked.”
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_AUDITOR_PASS
  It’s defensible. It defines “field presence” as an operational necessity, ties it to a training acknowledgement, and limits liability by documenting the boundary conditions.
  It won’t make you safe. It will make you legible.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_AUDITOR_FAIL
  It reads like someone trying to survive a question they already got asked once. Clean language. Hard edges.
  If you have to explain it out loud, you’ll lose time.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_TAKE_TEMPLATE
  You pull the training waiver template free. The paper has that slightly waxy finish that says “meant to be copied until nobody remembers where it came from.”
  It will read well in a binder.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_ADDED_TEMPLATE
  Added: Training Waiver Template.
  The rack settles back into place like it’s relieved you didn’t ask for a second copy.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_ENVELOPE_DESC
  A stack of pre-addressed envelopes. No return address, just a stamp box that’s been filled in with blocky, careful handwriting.
  The destination lines reference “Assurance Intake” and “Cross-Region Compliance,” like those are normal places you’d mail things.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_POSTMARKS
  The postmarks don’t match any local carrier mark you’ve seen. The dates are formatted with an extra digit, as if time needed a longer field.
  Someone has written “DO NOT LICK” on the top envelope. Underlined.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_UNSEALED
  There’s no instruction sheet, just a sticky note: “Seal only after attaching proof.”
  Proof of what isn’t specified, which is its own kind of policy.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_BARCODE_DESC
  A compliance notice printed on heavier stock than it deserves. The barcode is wrong in a very deliberate way—too dense, too tall, as if it expects a different reader.
  The header says “NOTICE OF NON-LOCAL COMPARABILITY REVIEW,” and the body text avoids nouns like it’s been sued before.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_READ_NOTICE
  It outlines a review process that assumes your facility is “operationally adjacent” to something else. It never says what.
  At the bottom: “Failure to respond constitutes acknowledgement of receipt.” Someone circled “acknowledgement” like that’s the dangerous word.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_COMPARABLE
  The notice doesn’t answer questions. It only defines what counts as an answer.
  There’s a blank line labeled “Local Reference Facility,” and it’s been left blank with confidence.
- SCN-029 / DG_SCN_029_COMPLIANCE_NOTICES / N_LEAVE
  You step back from the paperwork long enough to remember you’re here to finish a shutdown, not adopt a new bureaucracy.
  The room stays exactly as it was, waiting to be cited.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N001_INTRO
  The Copy and Fax Room smells like hot plastic and old staples.
  
  The fax machine sits under a laminated sign that says: “TRANSMISSIONS ARE RECORDS.”
  
  In your hands: the training waiver template you pulled earlier—blank where it matters.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N021_SEND_NARR
  The machine takes the first page like it’s accepting blame.
  
  It dials. It squeals. It goes quiet in a way that suggests “quiet” is also a setting with liability implications.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N022_SEND_NARR2
  A minute later, the tray twitches.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N030_TEMPLATE_READ
  The template is written in a tone that assumes someone will later ask why it existed.
  
  The checkbox reads: “I acknowledge receipt of required training materials.”
  
  Not “I completed.” Not “I understood.”
  
  Just receipt—like training is a package that can be delivered to a body.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N041_SERVICE_NARR
  You key in numbers the machine should not accept from you. It accepts them anyway.
  
  The display adds “CONFIRMATION: ON” like it’s a moral stance.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N050_SERVICE_FAIL
  You reach for the “right numbers” and come up short.
  
  Either you don’t have the access, or you don’t have the procedure clean enough to risk it. The machine keeps its bland, default contrast—perfect for receipts, terrible for liability.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N100_RETURN_INTRO
  The fax coughs out a return transmission—two pages.
  
  The first is your template, now signed. The second is a cover sheet that reads like a boundary dispute.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N121_PULL_NARR
  The pages are warm at the edges, as if heat counts as authentication.
  
  The signature is real. The language around it is a fence.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N122_CAVEATS
  “TRAINING WAIVER — NARROW PURPOSE ACKNOWLEDGMENT.”
  
  “This instrument does not certify completion of training. It permits site process to treat the undersigned as trained for closure-documentation tasks only.”
  
  “No inference of competency, safety baseline, or authorization is created by this acknowledgment.”
  
  The word authorization is struck through and replaced with administrative accommodation in different ink.
- SCN-030 / DG_SCN030_TRAINING_WAIVER_RETURN / N140_COVER_READ
  The cover sheet is a memo pretending to be a courtesy.
  
  “OLEA LEGAL TRANSMISSION — RECORD COPY.”
  
  “Please note: ‘trained’ is an operational label, not a factual representation.”
  
  The sentence ends with a period that looks pressed too hard.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_ENTER
  The Operations Corridor is narrow and bright in the way only institutional lighting can manage.
  
  Four things compete for your attention: an interlock panel with a calendar sticker, a main lockout point with a small forest of padlocks, a ventilation indicator with a sealed lens, and a stack of procedure placards that look handled often and obeyed rarely.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_INTERLOCK_DESC
  The panel is labeled: “ACCESS INTERLOCK — TRAINING DATE VALIDATION.”
  A small window shows a date field and a status light that refuses to be green.
  
  A laminated note is taped below the keypad: “DATE IS AUTHORITATIVE. DO NOT ‘ESTIMATE.’”
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_INTERLOCK_BLOCKING
  A diagram shows the interlock sits upstream of “service access authorization,” which then feeds into “controls enable.”
  
  The lines are straight. The logic is not.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_INTERLOCK_ERROR
  The screen displays: “TRAINING CURRENCY OUT OF RANGE.”
  Under it, smaller: “RANGE DEFINED BY POLICY REV 7B.”
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_INTERLOCK_DONE
  So: the training-date interlock.
  
  It’s upstream of access/enable, and it refuses to interpret your situation generously.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_COMPLIANCE_DIAL
  A phone number is printed in the corner with the confidence of a signature. You dial.
  After three tones, someone picks up like they were already speaking.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_COMPLIANCE_HANGUP
  The line stays open half a second too long, like they’re waiting to be quoted.
  Then it ends decisively, as if you dialed them by mistake.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_LOTO_DESC
  A steel hasp assembly is bolted to a main disconnect enclosure.
  Padlocks hang in layers. Tags overlap. Some are new. Some look like they were printed by a different century.
  
  A header placard reads: “LOTO IS PERSONAL. NO EXCEPTIONS.”
  Someone has underlined “PERSONAL” hard enough to tear the laminate. It feels recent.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_LOTO_COUNT
  There are more locks than names you recognize.
  Two tags are OLEA. One is a contractor you’ve never heard of. One is blank except for a date that’s been rewritten twice.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_LOTO_BLANKS
  A secondary tag clipped to the hasp says: “UNASSIGNED TAGS ARE STILL ASSIGNED.”
  It includes a reference number and a promise that a log exists somewhere.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_LOTO_DONE
  So: LOTO requirements.
  
  The disconnect handle is physically blocked, and any progress requires personal lock discipline and a verified zero-energy state—without interpreting paperwork gaps as permission.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_SAFETY_DIAL
  You dial the second number on the placard, the one printed smaller as if embarrassed.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_SAFETY_HANGUP
  They exhale like they’ve been holding that sentence for months.
  The lock tree stays exactly as it is, which is the only outcome it permits.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_VENT_DESC
  The indicator is mounted at eye level, behind a sealed lens that has been cleaned in a tight circle, as if clarity is allowed only where needed.
  A simple legend: GREEN = NORMAL, AMBER = PURGE, RED = RESTRICTED.
  
  The light is amber. The word “PURGE” has been relabeled once with a printed sticker that doesn’t quite fit.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_VENT_BLOCKS
  A nearby placard states: “NO ACCESS BEYOND THIS POINT UNLESS VENTILATION = NORMAL AND LOTO VERIFIED.”
  It is signed by nobody and initialed by someone.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_VENT_WHY
  A smaller note, typed and taped like an apology: “PURGE MAY INDICATE SENSOR SELF-TEST. DO NOT ASSUME AIRFLOW.”
  The note is dated five years ago. The tape is newer.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_VENT_TEST
  You lift the cover. The tamper strip cracks with a sound that will definitely be discussed later.
  You press TEST.
  
  Nothing changes. A tiny indicator next to the button lights: “INTERLOCK INHIBIT.”
  
  Interlock’s upstream.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_VENT_DONE
  So: a ventilation status dependency.
  
  Access/verification steps are conditioned on NORMAL, but the indicator itself can be inhibited by upstream interlock logic.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_FACILITIES_DIAL
  You dial. The phone answers on the first ring, like it was waiting to be blamed.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CALL_FACILITIES_HANGUP
  The amber light keeps shining with the calm certainty of a warning nobody owns.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_PLAC_DESC
  A metal rack holds laminated placards, each one numbered, each one revised, each one contradicting the next like a committee argument preserved in plastic.
  
  Placard 1: “VERIFY TRAINING CURRENCY PRIOR TO ENABLE.”
  Placard 2: “APPLY PERSONAL LOTO PRIOR TO ENTRY.”
  Placard 3: “CONFIRM VENTILATION NORMAL PRIOR TO LOTO VERIFICATION.”
  Placard 4: “IF VENTILATION NOT NORMAL, INITIATE PURGE USING ENABLED CONTROLS.”
  
  A final placard sits behind the rest, less handled:
  “IF REQUIREMENTS CONFLICT, STOP AND DOCUMENT CONSTRAINTS. DO NOT RESOLVE VIA ASSUMPTION.”
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_PLAC_LOOP
  It doesn’t resolve by action. It resolves by definition.
  
  The stack does not provide a pen. It assumes you brought one, or someone else did.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_CONTACTS_INTRO
  There are multiple numbers, each promising authority. None promising help.
  
  No one answers “Who owns this corridor?” out loud.
  Pick a number: Compliance Desk, Safety Coordinator, or Facilities Operator.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_COMMIT_INTRO
  Between the interlock, the lock point, and the ventilation indicator, the corridor has the shape of a closed fist.
  
  It doesn’t stop you by force. It stops you by making every next step require a previous step you cannot take.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_COMMIT_WRITEUP
  You write it in the only language that survives audits:
  
  - Training-date interlock blocks enable/access.
  - LOTO requirements prevent manipulation without personal lock and verified zero-energy state.
  - Ventilation status dependency requires NORMAL before access/verification steps, and the indicator is inhibited by the interlock.
  
  Your handwriting stays steady. Your jaw doesn’t. That counts as composure.
- SCN-031 / OPS_CORRIDOR_INTERLOCKS_LOTO / N_SHOW_NOTES
  You forward the summary without commentary. The system accepts it like a confession.
  
  No reply arrives fast enough to be useful.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_INTRO_1
  The training date interlock panel sits at chest height, bolted to the corridor wall like an apology. Its screen is lit. The green light is off.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_INTRO_2
  On-screen: TRAINING STATUS: NOT CURRENT. Subtext: LOTO ACCESS WITHHELD PENDING DATE-SHAPED VERIFICATION.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_INTRO_7
  The panel emits a quiet chirp, like it wants you to feel responsible for it.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_TALK_1
  You wait. The intercom clicks, as if someone moved a cup off a button.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_LOOK_1
  A scratched optical reader. A faded label: “TRAINING: ENTER DATE / PRESENT PROOF.” Someone has underlined DATE twice, hard enough to tear the laminate.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_ASK_WHAT_6
  The “Not Current” message does not change.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_ASK_WHY_4
  The panel flashes a small warning icon: “USER ENGAGED: PROVIDE PROOF.” It feels accusatory, but it’s just pixels.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_WAIVER_2
  You hold the signed waiver up to the panel camera. The paper is creased where it’s been folded and unfolded too many times. The signature block is darker, like someone pressed too hard.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_WAIVER_4
  The panel scans. It takes longer than it should, as if the delay is part of the lesson.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_WAIVER_5
  On-screen: WAIVER VERIFIED. Then: TRAINING STATUS: CONDITIONALLY CURRENT.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_WAIVER_7
  The green light clicks on. A relay somewhere behind the wall answers with a dull thunk. The panel displays: ACCESS RESTORED. PROCEED TO LOTO MAIN LOCK POINT.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_2
  You peel a small token sticker from a backing strip— glossy, date-colored, the kind that exists because printers lie. You place it over the optical reader’s worn window.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_5
  The reader pulses red, then amber, then— as if embarrassed— green.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_6
  On-screen: TOKEN ACCEPTED. Then: TRAINING STATUS: CURRENT (LOCAL).
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_9
  The green light clicks on. The corridor feels unchanged, but the lock logic is now willing to pretend you exist. The panel displays: ACCESS RESTORED. PROCEED TO LOTO MAIN LOCK POINT.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_LEAVE_2
  You step back. The panel keeps its screen lit, waiting to be satisfied. It does not time out. It just holds a grudge politely. You are still in the Operations Corridor. The training gate remains uncleared.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / INTRO_1
  The Operations Corridor narrows into a pocket of signage and hardware: a red-painted lock point, a laminated placard stack on a clip, and a label maker bolted down like it’s part of the facility. A single inspection tag hangs on a wire ring. The rest is empty hooks and old adhesive shadows.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / INTRO_2
  A placard above the hasp reads: “LOCKOUT/TAGOUT — ALL ENERGY SOURCES.” Someone has underlined “ALL” twice, carefully.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / LOOK_PLACARDS_1
  The top placard is current enough to be embarrassing. It wants: date, work order, name, contact, device ID, and “reason for isolation.” There’s a handwritten note in the margin: “TEMP TAGS OK IF PHOTO ATTACHED.” The handwriting is precise, like someone trying not to be remembered.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / LOOK_SUBPOINTS_1
  The subpoints list is longer than the hardware suggests: ventilation interlock, panel feed, auxiliary drive, and a “legacy bypass” that has no corresponding label. A sticker says: “DO NOT REMOVE — HISTORICAL.” It is peeling from the bottom up, stubbornly.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / PHONE_1
  The wall phone answers on the second ring, like it was already held.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / HANGUP_1
  The dial tone returns like a relieved sigh.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / SHOW_1
  You hold your credential up to the phone camera mounted above the placard stack. The lens smears the text, but the seal is clear enough to be annoying.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / APPLY_1
  The label maker wakes up with a thin, offended beep. The tape cartridge is half-full and slightly yellowed, like it’s been waiting longer than it should. You type device IDs from the placard list, one at a time, and print TEMP tags with matching dates.
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / APPLY_2
  You apply the single real inspection tag to the main lock point, then affix the printed TEMP tags at the listed subpoints, aligning them so they look intentional. You annotate the placard: date/time, work order, device IDs, and the reason: “Inventory limitation — TEMP tags used at subpoints; primary isolation tagged at main.”
- SCN-033 / DG_LOTO_MAIN_LOCKPOINT / LEAVE_1
  You leave the lock point as you found it: one real tag on a ring, and a placard that expects a world with supplies. The corridor remains open to the adjacent screens.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_START
  Operations Corridor. Interlocks on the wall, locks on the locks, and a placard stack that looks like it’s been fed for decades.
  A small indicator labeled VENTILATION STATUS blinks like it’s trying not to.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_START_HOTSPOTS
  Hotspots: Training date interlock panel. LOTO main lock point. Ventilation status indicator. Procedure placard stack.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_LOOK_VENT
  A yellowed lens over two legends: DAMPER OPEN and DAMPER CLOSED.
  OPEN is dark. CLOSED is lit.
  Under it: “STATUS VALID ONLY IF SENSOR IN CALIBRATION.” Someone underlined CALIBRATION three times, carefully.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_LOOK_PLACARD
  Plastic sleeves, curled at the corners. The top sheet is titled: “OPS SEQUENCE — START/SAFE/STOP (INTERLOCKED).”
  A note is taped over the footer: “Do not remove note.” The tape has been replaced several times.
  
  Step 1 is printed in bold: “VERIFY VENTILATION DAMPER = OPEN (REMOTE INDICATION REQUIRED).”
  Step 2: “INITIATE OPS SEQUENCE.”
  Step 3: “CONFIRM INTERLOCK SATISFIED.”
  Someone added pen: “If it’s not satisfied, do not interpret.”
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_LOOK_TRAINING
  A small panel with a keyed selector and a mechanical date window: LAST TRAINING VALID THROUGH.
  The date is current by a margin that feels personal. Next to it: “INTERLOCK ENABLED WHEN TRAINING VALID.”
  There’s a faint rectangle where an older label used to be.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_LOOK_LOTO
  A thick hasp assembly with enough holes for a committee. The tag pocket is empty, which is either good news or an administrative lie.
  A smaller engraved plate reads: “LOCKOUT DOES NOT OVERRIDE PROCESS INTERLOCKS.” The font is smug.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_USE_TRAINING
  You don’t have the key. The selector doesn’t move. A tiny status LED labeled OPS PERMIT is red.
  Below it, printed like it’s tired of being asked: “OPS PERMIT REQUIRES: TRAINING VALID; LOTO CLEAR; VENT DAMPER OPEN.”
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_BLOCKS
  The indicator has no opinion, but the panel labels do. “OPS PERMIT REQUIRES… VENT DAMPER OPEN.”
  Whatever “ops” means today, it’s waiting on a damper to testify.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_DEPENDENCY
  The ops start sequence is interlocked until the ventilation damper reports OPEN.
  The corridor provides no further justification, only cross-references.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_WHY_OPEN
  The placard doesn’t answer, it escalates. A sub-bullet under STOP reads:
  “Damper must be OPEN to validate purge complete prior to SAFE state.”
  Someone wrote in the margin: “OPEN proves you can CLOSE. Don’t argue with it.”
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_WHAT_IF_CLOSED
  A warning box, all caps: “SEQUENCE WILL NOT ARM.”
  Under it, a softer line like an apology: “Do not bypass. If bypassed, document bypass.”
  The document reference is smudged, as if the number itself was a liability.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_BYPASS_FORM
  A cross-reference number trails off into a smear of ink and thumbprints. Either the form existed once, or it exists somewhere that doesn’t want to be found.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_WHERE_DAMPER
  A directional sticker on the bottom of the indicator points left: SERVICE CORRIDOR / DUCT ACCESS.
  It’s the first helpful thing in the hall, which makes it suspect.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_WHO_DECIDED
  The placard cites “SITE SAFETY BASIS — REV. 6” and then cites a revision history that stops mid-line.
  The corridor’s position is clear: the decision exists, therefore it is correct, therefore it must be followed.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_SHOW_INTERLOCK
  OPS PERMIT REQUIRES: TRAINING VALID. LOTO CLEAR. VENT DAMPER OPEN.
  No nuance, no context, no appeal.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_REQUIREMENT
  The language is defensive and circular—written to survive arguments.
  It doesn’t ask for comfort ventilation. It asks for an OPEN signal it can point to later.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_GATED_INTRO
  A line on the placard uses the phrase “START SEQUENCE ARMS SAFE/STOP LOGIC.” It’s written by someone who expects arguments.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_START_PERMIT
  Yes. It’s not asking for airflow as a comfort condition. It’s asking for the damper’s OPEN signal as a prerequisite to arming the ops sequence logic at all.
  The system isn’t making air; it’s making a statement it can later point to.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_ANS_FAN_INTERLOCK
  It’s presented like that, but the wording is tighter than comfort logic.
  It’s a permit gate: the OPEN indication is treated like a prerequisite for the sequence to arm at all.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_CONFIRM_UNTIL_OPEN
  Correct. Ops start sequence is blocked until the ventilation damper reports OPEN.
- SCN-034 / OPS_VENT_DEPENDENCY / N_N_FINAL_FLAVOR
  The corridor offers you the dignity of knowing what to do next, and none of the tools to do it here.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / INTRO
  The ventilation access panel sits in the service corridor like it was added after someone lost an argument. A plastic window shows a tiny flag: “CLOSED,” or possibly “CL0SED.” The font is doing its best.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / LOOK_BEFORE
  The panel label reads: “SUPPLY DAMPER — DO NOT ADJUST (UNLESS AUTHORIZED).” Under it, someone has written “AUTHORIZED = ANYONE WITH A PEN,” then crossed that out, carefully.
  
  Your jaw tightens once, then relaxes. You’ve seen worse handwriting on better consequences.
  
  Through the window: the indicator cable moves. The blade does not. The little status flag continues to report with confidence.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / USE_FIX_AND_SET_OPEN
  The quarter-turn latches give with a dry pop. Dust drops in a straight line, as if it has an appointment.
  
  Inside: a linkage arm, a return spring, and a damper shaft that’s pretending friction is policy.
  
  You brace the linkage, take the load off the spring, and work the shaft back and forth until it stops being a negotiation. There’s a faint metallic click—less “fixed,” more “now it’s your problem.”
  
  The blade rotates. Air shifts tone in the duct, like someone stopped holding their breath.
  
  You seat the damper to OPEN and lock the linkage. A green sticker in the panel reads “VERIFY POSITION BY INDICATOR ONLY,” which is bold, considering the indicator has been lying to you for several minutes.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / LOOK_AFTER
  The flag now reads “OPEN.” It also reads “OP EN,” because the plastic window is warped. Close enough for a form.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / CYCLE_AFTER
  You swing the damper shut, then open again—one full cycle. The spring returns without drama.
  
  For a second, you catch yourself waiting for a sound that would justify paperwork. Nothing obliges.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / SHOW_MAIN_1
  You bring up the closure checklist entry and hold it to the panel like you’re introducing them. Your thumb covers a date field out of habit.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / SHOW_AFTER_1
  You bring up the closure checklist entry and hold it to the open panel like you’re introducing them. Your thumb covers a date field out of habit.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / LEAVE_COMMIT_1
  You let the panel hang open for a moment, just to confirm nothing re-sticks out of spite. The damper holds position.
  
  The status reports OPEN.
- SCN-035 / SCN_035_VENT_PANEL / LEAVE_NO_CHANGE_1
  You step back into the corridor. The panel stays exactly what it was: an argument someone bolted to the wall.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / NARRATOR_ENTER
  The Control Room smells like warmed dust and laminated paper.
  Three consoles. One alarm panel with too many labeled lights. A log printer still feeding itself.
  A procedure binder sits open like it was abandoned mid-sentence.
  
  On the wall: generic compliance notices. “POST THIS NOTICE.” “DO NOT REMOVE THIS NOTICE.” None of them say who wrote them.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / CONSOLE_DESC
  The main console is powered. The screen shows load routing and a status banner: CONTINUOUS BASELINE EXPORT.
  Someone has taped a handwritten label over a switch: “DO NOT CYCLE (ASK FIRST).”
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / ALARM_DESC
  The alarm panel is quiet: no horns, no strobes.
  Several indicator lamps are lit anyway, labeled with comforting words like NORMAL and BYPASS.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / PRINTER_DESC
  The log printer is warm.
  It has been printing in the slow, stubborn way of a system that believes it will be read.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / PRINTER_NOTICE
  The top page: ROUTING SUMMARY / EXPORT LEDGER.
  Below it: NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE NOTICE — DO NOT DISCARD.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / PRINTER_SHOW_NARRATOR
  You hold the page up. The paper curls like it resents being observed.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / BINDER_DESC
  The binder is tabbed, cross-referenced, and slightly swollen from humidity.
  The cover sheet says: SPINDLE SITE — OPERATOR SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE (OFFICIAL).
  A sticky note at the top reads: “REVISION CHECKED (I THINK).”
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / COMPLIANT_NARRATOR_ANNOTATE
  You annotate the binder’s authorization gap with a field sign-off and timestamp.
  The act feels heavier than the pen.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / COMPLIANT_NARRATOR_ACCEPT
  The console accepts your credentials as if it’s been waiting to be allowed to remember them.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / READY_NARRATOR_COMPLIANT
  Operational controls unlock. Logging tabs appear: ROUTING, INTERLOCKS, EXPORT, EVENT HISTORY.
  The cursor blinks on a prompt: SELECT CONTROL DOMAIN.
  The room remains quiet.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / CONTINUITY_NARRATOR_REASON
  You flip into Operator Continuity.
  The console requests a reason code. There are only three. Two are jokes.
  You choose the one that looks least like a joke.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / CONTINUITY_NARRATOR_PRINTS
  The log printer clicks and advances a line: OPERATOR OF RECORD: FIELD SYSTEMS SPECIALIST (CONTINUITY).
  It prints it twice, as if to make sure.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / READY_NARRATOR_CONTINUITY
  Operational controls unlock. Logging tabs appear: ROUTING, INTERLOCKS, EXPORT, EVENT HISTORY.
  The cursor blinks on a prompt: SELECT CONTROL DOMAIN.
  The room remains quiet.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / LEAVE_CORRIDOR_DESC
  You step back into the corridor. The control room door closes like it’s keeping your place.
- SCN-036 / CTRLROOM_PAPERTRAIL / LEAVE_DECK_DESC
  You head toward the observation deck access. The control room’s printer keeps working behind you, unbothered.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_START
  The log printer tray sits half-open under the main console, like it never agreed to be part of “controls.” A narrow status light above it is dark.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_WAKE
  The status light blinks once, as if reconsidering. Inside, rollers wake with a dry, expensive-sounding squeal.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_WAIT
  The paper advances one clean inch and stops. It is waiting for you to decide what “initialization” means today.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_LOOK1
  The header is bold, overconfident, and formatted like it’s been through court.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_LOOK_ASK2
  The printer idles, faintly warm, like it has already taken your answer. The tray remains open.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_EXCURSIVE2
  The cursor blinks. It is patient in a way people aren’t. The paper does not retract.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_ASK4
  The printer gives a small chirp, offended on someone else’s behalf. The tray stays open, waiting.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_WITNESS_LOCKED
  There’s a box for a witness signature, but no one is physically here to become one. The option sits there anyway, like a trap you can’t afford yet.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_WITNESS_PASS2
  The printer offers a blank line like it’s offering shelter. The room stays empty anyway.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_COMMIT1
  You press the tray inward until the latch catches. Your hand hesitates at the last millimeter, the way it does when you’re about to create a document that can outlive you.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_COMMIT4
  The printer engages fully. Paper feeds with brisk certainty, as if the facility prefers text to electricity.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_COMMIT6
  A fresh printout slides into the tray—warm, time-stamped, and immediately useful as evidence that you were here and did the boring thing first. Baseline logging continues.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_LEAVE1
  You let the tray sit open. The printer stays quiet, pretending it wasn’t waiting on you. The Control Room keeps running in the background, like that settles anything.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_START
  The procedure binder is open to a laminated divider: OPERATIONAL STATUS VERIFICATION — DO NOT INITIATE UNLESS READY TO COMPLETE. A sticky note covers part of the header: “Ready means paper-ready, not emotionally ready.”
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_PREREQS
  Four prerequisites are stamped in green ink: Training Gate Cleared. LOTO Tagged. Vent Damper Open. There is no stamp for “This is a good idea.”
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_LOOK_SUMMARY_1
  The summary page is written in a font that assumes it will be photocopied until the end of time.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_LOOK_SUMMARY_2
  Step headings: Confirm control authority. Confirm load characteristics. Execute reflectivity test if indicated. Someone has underlined “if indicated” hard enough to crease the paper.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_LOOK_FOOTNOTE
  A footnote reads: “Reflectivity is a behavioral descriptor and does not imply optical compliance.” The ink looks resentful.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_TALK_PHONE_1
  The console’s desk phone has an extension label: EAC ASSURANCE — DOCUMENTATION SUPPORT ONLY. The handset cord is too short, as if designed to discourage pacing.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_HANGUP_1
  The line clicks off cleanly, as if relieved not to be involved.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_HANGUP_2
  The binder remains open, patient and procedural.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_INITIATE_1
  The initiation page is a single sheet on heavier paper, like it expects to be presented in a hearing.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_INITIATE_2
  Fields: Initiator Name. Badge. Time (24h). Scope. A boxed note reads: “Initiation indicates readiness to document outcomes. It does not indicate predicted safety.” The box is outlined twice.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_ACTIVATE_1
  You enter your details and initial the margin. The pen drags, then bites, like the paper is laminated with reluctance.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_ACTIVATE_2
  A perforated strip tears free automatically from the bottom edge: VERIFICATION ACTIVE — RETAIN ON PERSON.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_ACTIVATE_3
  In the printer tray, the feed motor wakes up. The first page doesn’t print yet. It just decides it will.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_ACTIVATE_4
  A new checkbox appears at the top of the active checklist: Reflectivity Test — REQUIRED.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_CLOSE_1
  You close the binder. The rings clack shut like a small verdict.
- SCN-038 / DG_OPERATIONAL_VERIFICATION_BINDER / N_CLOSE_2
  Nothing changes, which is its own kind of decision.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_EST_01
  The observation deck smells like old sealant and fresh paperwork.
  Beyond the window, SPINDLE rotates with the calm indifference of something that never had to justify itself.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_EST_02
  Three frames, three tempos, three sets of maintenance markings that do not agree.
  The central containment sphere is matte—over-insulated, dull, and very much not reflecting anything interesting today.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_EST_03
  On the deck: a reflectivity test station with a battered readout, a calibration puck in a foam cutout, and a return canister tray with slots labeled in two handwriting styles.
  The observation window latch has been touched recently. Or someone used a different cleaner. It’s hard to tell.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_STATION_01
  The reflectivity test station is bolted down like it might run away.
  A laminated procedure card is zip-tied to the frame—updated twice, both updates initialed by someone who didn’t print their name.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_STATION_02
  The readout is on, not bright. The kind of “on” that wants you to stop asking if it’s on.
  A sticky note says: “DO NOT CALL IT MIRROR. —Legal.”
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_STATION_WHAT_01
  The procedure card answers without enthusiasm: “Surface Response Under Controlled Illumination.”
  A handwritten addendum replaces “illumination” with “incident light,” like the old word got someone in trouble.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_PUCK_01
  The calibration puck sits in foam, immaculate in a way nothing else is.
  Its serial number is stamped twice, as if one stamp wasn’t defensible.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_PUCK_02
  A tag reads: “REFERENCE STANDARD — DO NOT POLISH.”
  Someone has underlined “POLISH” hard enough to dent the paper.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_PUCK_PICK_01
  It has weight, precise and unhelpful.
  The surface is deliberately boring—engineered to reflect exactly what it’s supposed to, and no more.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_PUCK_PICK_02
  Putting it back feels like returning a library book you never wanted on your record.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_TRAY_01
  The return canister tray is staged under the window line, like it expects traffic.
  Slots are labeled “INBOUND” and “RETURN,” which would be clearer if anything here ever went “bound” in a normal direction.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_TRAY_02
  One slot has a printed placard: “EMPTY IS A CONDITION, NOT AN ACTION.”
  It’s signed with a surname only. No date. That’s deliberate.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_TRAY_WHY_01
  A maintenance log clipped to the tray reads: “Keep clear for cycle completion.”
  The word “cycle” is circled twice, like it tried to escape the sentence.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_LATCH_01
  The latch is heavy and over-specified: two-step release, interlock indicator, and a little red window that shows either “SAFE” or “NOT SAFE,” with no further nuance.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_LATCH_02
  It currently reads “SAFE.”
  Someone has scratched an asterisk into the metal next to it. No legend. Just the asterisk.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_LATCH_TEST_01
  The handle gives a millimeter—then stops on an interlock that clicks with bureaucratic satisfaction.
  A placard on the frame reads: “DECK OPENING REQUIRES FLOOR PRESENCE CONFIRMATION.” The last two words are in bold, as if they can enforce physics.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_LATCH_TEST_02
  You can’t open it from here without making yourself “present” in the system, and the system is picky about what counts as you.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_WINDOW_01
  The rotating frames stay steady—no wobble, no stutter, no visible heat shimmer.
  The containment sphere remains matte, swallowing light the way insulation should.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_WINDOW_02
  Below, the reflectivity test station and return canister tray make sense as a pair: test, package, return.
  It’s the kind of sense that auditors like—simple, repeatable, and wrong in a familiar way.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_WINDOW_NOM_01
  Nominal by visual confirmation: rotation stable, sphere non-reflective, deck instrumentation present and staged.
  It is not reassurance. It is a checklist item that can survive discovery.
- SCN-039 / DG_SPNDLE_OBSERVE / N_LOG_01
  You record: “SPINDLE observed in nominal state from HUB-12. Containment sphere matte. Reflectivity test station present. Return canister tray staged.”
  Your hands don’t shake, but you catch yourself re-reading the sentence like it might accuse you later.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_INTRO_1
  The reflectivity test station sits under a hooded task light.
  A laminated protocol sheet is zip-tied to the frame like it might run away.
  The log slot is empty in the specific way an auditor would call “clean.”
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_INTRO_2
  On the bench: a calibration puck in a foam cradle.
  To the right: a pneumatic tube return tray with a paper-curl of labels ready to be fed.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_PROTOCOL_1
  The sheet is titled: SPINDLE – REFLECTIVITY VERIFICATION (SANCTIONED).
  Someone has underlined SANCTIONED hard enough to tear the laminate at the corner.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_PROTOCOL_2
  Steps are printed in calm bullet points:
  1) Confirm puck serial.
  2) Present puck to observation pane.
  3) Record surface response.
  4) If “alignment glint” occurs: document as UNEXPECTED REFLECTIVE BEHAVIOR.
  A note adds, in smaller font: “This is not a reflection. Legally.”
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_PROTOCOL_3
  A checkbox at the bottom reads: “Test Complete / No Deviations.”
  The checkbox is too optimistic to be trusted.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_PROTOCOL_4
  The menu waits, like it’s trying not to breathe.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_INTERCOM_BUTTON_1
  The intercom button is labeled ASSURANCE – COMPARABILITY.
  The label is newer than everything around it, which is its own kind of warning.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_USE_PUCK_1
  The calibration puck is heavier than it needs to be, like it was designed to convince someone.
  Its serial number is engraved deep enough to survive a fire and a budget meeting.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_USE_PUCK_2
  You place it against the marked pane, per protocol.
  The containment sphere below turns in its slow, wrong rhythm.
  For a moment, everything is just equipment.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_USE_PUCK_3
  Then the sphere hits an alignment that the protocol only half-admits exists.
  Its surface goes mirror-smooth— not bright, just certain.
  The reflection shows angles the room doesn’t contain.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_USE_PUCK_4
  When the puck touches the pane, it doesn’t clack or resist.
  It simply stops being on your side.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_LOOK_WINDOW_1
  The pane looks normal again: scuffed, institutional, slightly too thick.
  Your handprint remains.
  The puck does not.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_LOOK_WINDOW_2
  A faint, hairline shimmer recedes across the sphere like a thought being withdrawn.
  You have the uneasy sense that you were seen and correctly filed.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_RETURN_TRAY_1
  The return tray gives a soft pneumatic cough.
  A label spits out, curls, and settles with the smugness of completed paperwork.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_RETURN_TRAY_2
  It reads: RETURN CANISTER – MISROUTED ITEM.
  Item description: CALIBRATION PUCK (SEE ATTACHED ROUTING).
  Destination: blank.
  Origin: “SPINDLE / OBS DECK.”
  Status: “RETURNED.”
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_LABEL_DETAILS_1
  The barcode is crisp.
  The routing field is stamped OVERFLOW – MANUAL REVIEW, then crossed out.
  Someone—or something— re-stamped it AUTO-ACCEPTED.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_LABEL_DETAILS_2
  There’s no mention of loss, destruction, or anomaly.
  Just a path that goes somewhere you are not currently cleared to stand.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / N_TAKE_LABEL_1
  You peel the label free.
  The adhesive fights like it wants to remain evidence.
  It comes away intact.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / END_OUTCOME_ALIGNMENT_FLICKER
  You write the event in the sanctioned container: UNEXPECTED REFLECTIVE BEHAVIOR.
  Your handwriting stays steady on purpose.
  You attach the misrouted return label as supporting material, because it exists and therefore counts.
  The log slot accepts the page without comment.
  
  The station’s status light flips from AMBER to GREEN.
  Somewhere in the building, a system will interpret that as closure-adjacent.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / END_BACK_AWAY
  You step away from the station.
  The chamber continues its slow, budget-justified rotation.
  The empty foam cradle looks like it’s waiting to be blamed.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / END_STEP_BACK
  You step back from the pane.
  The room returns to its normal, institutional patience.
  Nothing explains itself. Nothing apologizes.
- SCN-040 / DG_REFLECTIVITY_TEST_STATION / END_POCKET_MOVE
  You pocket what you can and refuse to add a new noun to the building.
  The station waits for a version of events that fits in a checkbox.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_ENTER
  The SPINDLE chamber floor smells like old coolant and new paperwork.
  A dull containment sphere sits in the center, three rotating frames around it—each with maintenance markings that disagree by decade.
  Near the approach, a strip of witness-marker tape makes a neat, legal shape on the floor. It does not match any safety standard you recognize. It matches a form.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_SPHERE_A
  Up close, the sphere isn’t reflective so much as decisive.
  Most angles: matte insulation, scuffed like it’s been cleaned too carefully.
  One angle: your own silhouette returns with a half-second delay, as if the surface is waiting for permission. Your throat tightens and you file it as particulate interference.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_SPHERE_LABELS
  A metal placard is bolted on crooked.
  It reads: CONTAINMENT SPHERE — DO NOT POLISH.
  Someone underlined DO NOT twice, in marker that dried into the grain like it wanted to be permanent.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_STATUS_A
  A cluster of indicator lamps and a numeric display sits on a pedestal, like it expects a person to stand here and feel responsible.
  Labels are hand-applied: some typed, some stamped, some written in pencil and then “made official” with clear tape.
  The readouts don’t say ON or OFF. They say:
  ROTATION: CONTINUOUS
  ALIGNMENT: UNCONFIRMED / LAST: [blank]
  LOAD: STABLE (PER AGREEMENT)
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_STATUS_AGREEMENT
  There’s no answer—only the quiet insistence of the display.
  A tiny sticker beneath it says: IF QUESTIONED, REFER TO APPENDIX D.
  Appendix D is not present.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_STATUS_APPENDIX_PASS
  Appendix D is the kind of addendum that exists to make responsibility transferrable.
  It usually defines witness thresholds, recording requirements, and what counts as “presence” when someone later asks why a procedure happened without a second set of eyes.
  Here, it’s referenced like a shield and missing like a confession.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_STATUS_APPENDIX_FAIL
  You can’t reconstruct it from the labels alone.
  The reference is doing its job: it points somewhere that can’t contradict the panel today, but can contradict you later.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_PANEL_A
  The scan panel is mounted at waist height, clean enough to imply routine use.
  A camera. A palm reader. A small microphone grille.
  Above it: WITNESS REQUIREMENT ZONE — TWO-PERSON PRESENCE BEYOND THIS LINE.
  The line is the witness-marker tape. It encloses the panel and a narrow path toward the sphere, like a funnel.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_PANEL_USE_FAIL
  The panel wakes with a soft tone that tries to sound neutral.
  PRESENCE CHECK: INSUFFICIENT.
  Then, defensively: THIS IS NOT A DENIAL. THIS IS A REQUIREMENT.
  SECOND PRESENCE NOT DETECTED. DO NOT PROCEED ALONE.
  A final line appears, almost petty: COMPLIANCE LIKES CONSISTENCY.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_PANEL_USE_PASS
  The panel tone shifts—less defensive, more official.
  PRESENCE CHECK: SATISFIED.
  A prompt waits for you to make it a record.
  The tape line doesn’t move. The wording does: it stops being equipment and starts being testimony.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_PANEL_ACK
  You mark it mentally the way you’d mark a live bus bar: not dramatic, just absolute.
  Whatever “shutdown” means here, it starts when you step over the witness line and let the panel record you doing it.
  You now know where the facility stops being equipment and starts being testimony.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_ESTOP_A
  The emergency stop is a red mushroom button under a flip cover—the kind you can slap without thinking, if you’re willing to spend a year defending the slap.
  A tag dangles: SEALED — USE REQUIRES POST-ACTION AUTHORIZATION.
  A placard answers like it’s been in court before:
  EMERGENCY STOP INITIATES CONTROLLED DECELERATION SEQUENCE WHERE PRACTICABLE.
  Then, smaller: PRACTICABLE IS DETERMINED RETROACTIVELY.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_ESTOP_USE
  You lift the cover. The hinge squeaks in a way that feels like a witness.
  Under the button, another label: DO NOT USE TO SIMPLIFY PROCEDURE.
  That one is new.
  You don’t press it. Even standing here, you can already hear the memo being drafted about what you “intended.”
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_LEAVE_OBS_UNKNOWN
  You take one last look across the floor—the sphere, the lights, the tape that pretends it’s just tape.
  Then you head for the stairs down to the observation deck. The hum follows you, consistent as a policy.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_LEAVE_OBS_KNOWN
  You take one last look at the witness perimeter, like it might move when you aren’t watching. It doesn’t.
  You head for the stairs down to the observation deck. The hum follows you, consistent as a policy.
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_LEAVE_OVERFLOW_UNKNOWN
  You angle back toward the overflow intake concourse.
  The chamber stays behind you, quietly maintaining its version of “normal.”
- SCN-041 / DG_WITNESS_ZONE_IDENTIFICATION / N_LEAVE_OVERFLOW_KNOWN
  You angle back toward the overflow intake concourse with the tape line fixed in your mind as a procedural edge.
  The chamber stays behind you, quietly maintaining its version of “normal.”
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_START_NARR
  The alarm panel is already lit with the soft, constant status of a system proving it is allowed to exist. A new banner overlays the verification checklist: DEMAND EVENT — LOAD SHED REQUESTED.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_MENU_INTRO
  The panel shows three quick links: VIEW DETAILS, PRINT EVENT, ACKNOWLEDGE/RESPOND.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_COMMIT_HOLD_NARR
  The scene holds on the blinking ACK light, like it wants a signature.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_UNDERSTOOD_NARR
  The alarm panel stops nagging and starts waiting.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_CONF_NARR
  The open channel hisses softly, impatient in a professional way.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_PRINT_NARR
  The log printer wakes up like it was pretending not to hear you. A strip of paper curls into the tray: DEMAND EVENT UTIL-DS-4419, time-stamped, with a header serial number.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_REVIEW_NARR
  The demand event detail page is mostly disclaimers: “best effort,” “no guarantee,” “operator responsible.” The shed target is clear; the definitions are not.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_STEP_AWAY_NARR
  You step back. The demand event banner stays up, patiently escalating itself in the background.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_START_NARR
  The main console is already on a LOAD-SHED RESPONSE overlay, pinned on top of the shutdown verification UI. A yellow banner persists: DEMAND EVENT ACTIVE — RESPONSE REQUIRED.
  Under it, almost offended: VERIFICATION MODE: STABILITY REQUIRED.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_MENU_INTRO
  The console shows big, friendly buttons that all look like liability: VIEW LOAD MAP. PRINT ACTION HEADER. CONFIGURE SHED. EXECUTE ROUTING.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_MAP_NARR
  The screen redraws into a block diagram: feeder names, breaker groups, and three categories of load with mismatched fonts.
  CRITICAL includes chamber environmental, rotation frame lubrication, and a box labeled VERIFICATION SUPPORT that is, unhelpfully, most of the building.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_MAP_ASK_NARR
  Three shed presets highlight. None meet the target alone.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_GROUP_NARR
  Several groups carry a warning: AUTO-RECOVER ENABLED — RESTART SURGE LIKELY.
  A few are annotated in terse maintenance shorthand: “CHATTER RISK,” “THERMAL LAG,” “DO NOT CYCLE.”
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_CONFIG_INTRO
  A configuration pane opens: TARGET SHED: 12 MW. The slider is disabled; only presets can be accepted.
  Two tabs: STAGED and SINGLE-STEP. The cursor blinks like it wants a signature.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_STAGED_INTRO
  The console assembles three staged groups. The third is marked: VERIFICATION SUPPORT — TEMPORARY RECLASS REQUIRED.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_RECLASS_NARR
  A dialog box appears with a legal tone and a petty request: SELECT JUSTIFICATION CODE.
  The available codes are pre-filled. None are kind.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_RECLASS_DONE_NARR
  VERIFICATION SUPPORT flips from CRITICAL to NONCRITICAL with no animation, like it’s ashamed.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_SINGLESTEP_INTRO
  The console offers one macro: EXECUTE ROUTING: ALIGNMENT-SEQUENCE LOAD ROUTING (12 MW CLEAN).
  A warning line beneath it: NOTE: MAY ALTER VERIFICATION BASELINE. The word “may” is doing too much work.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_FINAL_WARN_NARR
  The console asks for final confirmation in all caps, like volume is authority:
  ACKNOWLEDGE: ROUTING WILL INITIATE AUTOMATED ALIGNMENT CONTROL.
  The confirm button is labeled: I ACKNOWLEDGE.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_CANCEL_NARR
  You back out. The macro remains highlighted, waiting like it knows you’ll return.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_LOG_NARR
  The console logs a new line item: ALIGNMENT CONTROL: ARMED. ROUTING: IN PROGRESS.
  In the corner, the small chamber camera feed stutters.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_FLICKER_NARR
  The containment sphere’s surface flickers—matte to reflective, reflective to matte—like a thought it isn’t allowed to have.
  The console continues counting down routing steps as if nothing visual is relevant.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_PRINT_NARR
  The log printer wakes with a reluctant whine. A strip curls into the tray:
  ACTION HEADER — CONTROL ROOM CONSOLE, with a serial and timestamp.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_STEP_AWAY_NARR
  You step back. The demand banner stays pinned, politely escalating itself at the edge of your vision.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_START_01
  The containment sphere is fully mirror-bright now.
  Your reflection arrives from a direction the room doesn’t have.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_START_02
  The status indicator cluster ticks over with the calm certainty of a finished form.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_STEPBACK_01
  You take a step back.
  The sphere keeps reflecting you like you didn’t.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_STATUS_LOOK_01
  The indicator cluster shows green lamps with old labels: VERIFIED, WITNESS, SURFACE READY.
  A smaller amber lamp reads: TERMINOLOGY VARIANCE — NONE.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SCAN_USE_01
  The scan panel wakes with a soft chime that sounds like it was approved by committee.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_ESTOP_USE_01
  The emergency stop is a red mushroom button with a laminated tag that has been re-laminated.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_PROCEED_NARR_01
  The sphere’s mirror surface stops reflecting the room and starts reflecting a flat, bright absence.
  Your weight shifts as if the floor forgot a rule.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_PROCEED_NARR_02
  Your reflection steps forward first.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_INTRO_1
  The Overflow Intake Concourse is lit like an apology.
  Queue stanchions form a maze that leads nowhere in particular.
  A barcode kiosk waits with the patience of a machine that has never been wrong.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_INTRO_2
  Left: a sealed bay door labeled “APERTURE SIDE — AUTHORIZED TOKENED ENTRY ONLY.”
  Center: “INCIDENT QUEUE” stanchions with numbered placards that skip numbers.
  Right: a corridor sign points toward “INTAKE HALL (WINDOWS 0/3/5/7/9).”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_LOOK_KIOSK_1
  The kiosk screen reads: “SCAN TOKEN OR ATTACH BARCODED MASS.”
  Below it, a slot labeled “UNALLOCATED” has been taped over, then carefully re-labeled “ALLOCATABLE.”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_LOOK_KIOSK_2
  A laminated note adds: “PEOPLE ARE NOT VALID INPUTS.”
  Someone underlined “NOT” so hard the ink bled.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_LOOK_QUEUE_1
  The stanchions are arranged like a lesson.
  A placard at the start says: “QUEUE BEGINS WHEN YOUR INCIDENT EXISTS.”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_LOOK_QUEUE_2
  At the end: “WINDOW ASSIGNMENT IS TOKEN-DEPENDENT.”
  A second placard, smaller, says: “DO NOT ARGUE WITH WINDOWS ON THE RECORD.”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_LOOK_DOOR_1
  The door has no handle. It has a reader.
  The reader has a polite little light that stays off, like it’s conserving disbelief.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_LOOK_DOOR_2
  A posted procedure lists three steps.
  Step one is “PRESENT TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT RECEIPT (TER).”
  Step two is blank.
  Step three is “DO NOT FORCE THE DOOR.”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_USE_KIOSK_1
  The kiosk wakes up halfway, like it’s doing you a favor.
  A prompt appears: “TOKEN REQUIRED FOR PERSONHOOD.”
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_USE_DOOR_1
  You present nothing to the reader.
  The reader responds appropriately: not at all.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_GET_TOKEN_INFO_5
  The Coach points right, toward the Intake Hall signage, as if pointing is a legally safer form of escort.
- SCN-045 / SCN_045_OVERFLOW_INTAKE / N_GET_TOKEN_INFO_6
  On the kiosk, the prompt refreshes: “PRESENT TOKEN.”
  It blinks once, like a reminder that the building has already moved on.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N1_ESTABLISH
  The barcode kiosk is bolted to a waist-high pedestal like it’s part of the floor plan.
  A green “READY” light blinks with practiced patience.
  A thermal printer sits under a plastic hood, already slightly curled from old output.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N2_HAVE_LABEL
  You have the Misrouted Canister Return Label.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_LOOK_N1
  A laminated placard is taped beside the scanner. The tape has been replaced often; the placard hasn’t.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_LOOK_N2
  Below that, in smaller print: “UNALLOCATED MASS IS NOT AN ACCUSATION.”
  
  The READY light blinks as if trying not to blink too hard.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_LEAVE_N1
  You step back. The kiosk remains ready, like it’s waiting to witness you make a better decision.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_N1
  You pass the Misrouted Canister Return Label under the scanner.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_N2
  The printer whines, then snaps forward a strip of thermal paper.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_N3
  The slip hangs half-torn from the dispenser, warm at the edge.
- SCN-046 / DG_UNALLOCATED_MASS_KIOSK / N_USE_N4
  You take it.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_INTRO_1
  The Intake Hall is a straight corridor of windows and rules.
  It feels like a DMV built by a risk committee.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_INTRO_2
  Five counters. Five numbers that skip comfort: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9.
  Each window has a placard like a verdict.
  A forms rack stands between them, stocked with “MISROUTED CARGO TEMPLATES,” all crisp, all wrong in advance.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_LOOK_PLACARDS_1
  Window 0 reads: “INTAKE (TER).”
  The “(TER)” looks added later, with a different laminate.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_LOOK_PLACARDS_2
  Window 3: “ORIENTATION — SUBJECT TO VALID STATUS.”
  Window 5: “SAFETY — INCIDENTS ONLY.”
  Window 7: “PROPERTY — CLAIMS REQUIRE CLAIMANT.”
  Window 9: “COMPLAINTS — PROCESSED, NO ACTION.”
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_LOOK_FORMS_1
  The rack is divided into categories with comforting names.
  “Misrouted Cargo,” “Label Failure,” “Unclaimed Attachments.”
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_LOOK_FORMS_2
  Someone has highlighted a line on one template:
  “ASSOCIATED MASS (DO NOT DESCRIBE).”
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COACH_INTRO_1
  The Process Coach stands where you can’t tell if they’re helping you or helping throughput.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN3_1
  Window 3 has pamphlets arranged like a threat.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN5_1
  Window 5 has a yellow light that never turns off.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN7_1
  Window 7 has a stamp pad that looks loved.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN9_1
  Window 9 has a stack of forms already stamped.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN0_INTRO_1
  Window 0 is the only counter without pamphlets.
  The space is clean in the way a form is clean—because nothing personal has been allowed to touch it.
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COMMIT_1
  You point at the placard: “INTAKE (TER).”
- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_COMMIT_3
  The clerk slides a blank form forward, face-down, like it might try to read you back if you look too directly.
  You have identified the path. The actual filing comes next—when you choose what you are willing to be called.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_INTRO_1
  Window 0 is clean the way a form is clean—because nothing personal has been allowed to touch it.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_INTRO_2
  The Intake Clerk’s eyes track your Unallocated Mass Slip before they track you.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_FORM_SLIDE_1
  The clerk slides a blank template forward, face-down, like it might learn you if you look directly at it.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_TOOLBAG_5
  The clerk stamps the form twice, like the second stamp is for the parts of you that won’t fit on paper.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_RESIDUE_4
  The stamp lands with a soft finality, as if closing a file closes a door somewhere.
- SCN-048 / SCN_048_WINDOW0_TER / N_COACHED_2
  The clerk feeds the paper into a slot that was built for envelopes and now eats definitions.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / INTRO_NARR
  Window 3 is labeled ORIENTATION in peeling block letters. Behind glass: a clerk, a stamp pad, and a stack of thin pamphlets that look pre-handled. A placard lists rules in numbered paragraphs, as if the building is a person with boundaries.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / LOOK_NARR
  The top pamphlet is titled “WELCOME / COMPLIANCE / STAY WITHIN YOUR AUTHORIZED SHAPE.” Several have faint pen marks on the back—quick lines like someone drew a way out and then tried to forget they had hands.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / TAKE_NARR
  You take the pamphlet. On the back is a rough sketch in ballpoint: a corridor cut-through with a box labeled “MAP KIOSK / CORRIDOR ACCESS,” drawn like someone needed it once and then regretted needing it.
- SCN-049 / SCN_049_WINDOW3_ORIENTATION / LEAVE_NARR
  You leave the glass and its rules behind, for now.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N00_ESTABLISH
  Window 5: SAFETY. The glass is cloudy where hundreds of fingerprints gave up. A narrow slot waits beneath a sign that says: “ISSUANCE IS NOT ACCESS.”
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N51_TER_JUDGMENT
  You press the TER against the cloudy pane. The speaker goes quiet long enough to feel like judgment.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N61_HP_INSERT_PROMPT
  Something clacks behind the panel. A pneumatic tube coughs once, like it resents effort.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N70_HP_INSERT_GLOVE
  You feed a glove into the slot. The slot takes it without gratitude.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N72_HP_TAG_DROPS
  A small metal tag drops into the return tray. Stamped, numbered, and warm from the machine.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N74_HP_TAKE_TAG
  You take the glove tag. It sits in your palm like a tiny permission that refuses to call itself permission.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N81_ACC_PRINTER
  The window whirs. A printer somewhere produces a page you will never see.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N90_ACC_INSERT_GLOVE
  You feed a glove into the slot. The machine takes it like evidence.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N92_ACC_TAG_DROPS
  A small metal tag drops into the tray. It’s stamped with a number that looks more like a route than an ID.
- SCN-050 / SCN_050_WINDOW5_SAFETY / N94_ACC_TAKE_TAG
  You take the glove tag. The window’s speaker clicks off before you can ask the next question.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_INTRO_1
  Window 7 smells faintly of stamp ink and hand lotion.
  The counter is the same, but your badge changes what the glass is willing to hear.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_READY_TO_FILE_1
  The clerk pulls a small slip from a tray that isn't labeled. They hesitate, then commit their hand to the stamp pad.
- SCN-051 / SCN_051_WINDOW7_PROPERTY_STUB / N_PRINT_STUB_1
  The stamp lands once, hard. The clerk slides the slip under the glass with two fingers, like it might accuse them.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_INTRO_1
  Window 9 is lit like a fish tank: bright, clean, and designed to discourage movement.
  A placard under the glass reads: “COMPLAINTS — PROCESSED, NO ACTION.”
  The stamp tray is already inked, like it’s been waiting longer than you have.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_STAMP_FAST_3
  The clerk stamps once, hard, like they’re pinning the paper to the year it happened in.
  They slide it back under the glass without looking at your hands.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_PERSUADE_PASS_STAMP_2
  The clerk stamps, then stamps again—smaller—like they’re initialing their own denial.
- SCN-052 / SCN_052_WINDOW9_COMPLAINTS / N_STAMP_CONFIRM_2
  Ink. Paper. Finality.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N001_INTRO
  The map kiosk sits at the mouth of the service corridors like it’s part of the building’s immune system. The screen is on. The printer tray is empty on purpose.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N002_PLACARD
  A placard reads: “AUTHORIZED ROUTE OUTPUT ONLY.” The word “ONLY” has been re-inked by hand.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N074_PRINT_NARR
  The printer feeds a warm strip of paper, pauses as if reconsidering, then continues. The ink is slightly faded where it matters.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N076_TAKE_FRAGMENT
  You take the fragment. The kiosk screen goes blank like it has already moved on.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N099_END_SUCCESS
  Map Fragment 1 is added to your kit: concourse and service corridors, with just enough detail to be useful and just enough missing to be deniable.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N091_CANCEL_NARR
  The kiosk returns to its idle screen, patiently pretending it has never met you.
- SCN-053 / DG_LIM03_MAP_KIOSK / N098_END_CANCEL
  You step back from the kiosk without taking any output.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_INTRO
  The Legacy Interconnections Archive smells like dust that passed inspection.
  A catalog terminal waits under a plastic hood labeled: USE IS A FORM OF CREATION.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_SCAN
  You scan your routing barcode. The reader chirps like it resents you for being scannable.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_MATCH
  The screen populates with a legacy match before you finish exhaling.
  
  A record header blinks: “ENDPOINT: SOL‑EARTH‑LOCAL.”
  Below it: “MAINTENANCE LINEAGE: ACTIVE / RECURRING.”
  A final line is half-obscured by an access banner: “MANAGING AUTHORITY: UPSTREAM / EXTERNAL (UNNAMED).”
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_PLACARDS
  On the placards, the index rules are printed in three fonts, as if consensus was attempted and failed.
  
  Rule 4: “QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED AS HEADINGS.”
  Rule 9: “MOTIVE IS NOT AN INDEXABLE FIELD.”
  Someone has underlined “FIELD” twice, angrily.
  
  The terminal waits, ready to log your next phrasing as a permanent feature of reality.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_AUTH_DARE
  The terminal requests an authorization string you already have, which feels less like security and more like a dare.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_ACCESS_CLEARS_LONG
  You enter the string. The access banner clears.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_ABSTRACT_EXPANDS
  A legacy abstract expands:
  “ARCHIVE: ENDPOINT SOL‑EARTH‑LOCAL.”
  “STATUS: IN CATALOG PRIOR TO CURRENT SCHEME.”
  “MAINTENANCE LINEAGE: TIED TO EXISTING NODE; NOT NEWLY INTRODUCED.”
  “MANAGING AUTHORITY: UPSTREAM/EXTERNAL (UNNAMED).”
  “ASSOCIATED MATERIAL: DRAWER BANK 7 / SLICE B.”
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_DRAWER_BANK
  Drawer bank.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_MAP_FRAGMENT
  Inside: a thin cartographic insert, brittle at the folds.
  A fragment of a network map with SOL‑EARTH‑LOCAL circled in a hand that learned control by being denied it.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / NARRATOR_ACCESS_CLEAR_SHORT
  The access banner clears. The abstract expands. A drawer reference appears.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / END_PULL_LEGACY_METADATA
  You copy the legacy abstract into your notes and pocket the map fragment.
  The catalog quietly reclassifies you from “new irregularity” to “existing maintenance burden,” as if that’s kinder.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / END_LEAVE
  You step away before the archive can decide what category you belong in today.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / NARR_START
  The AMR registry reader sits under a hooded task light, as if it’s being interrogated. A slot labeled PRINTOUT is jammed with old perforated stock. The screen displays: SPONSOR REQUIRED.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / NARR_ISSUE_1
  The Maintainer keys in the entry with two fingers, like touching the wrong key could be construed as intent. The printer chatters and produces a single-page AMR printout with dense, aggressively boring language.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / NARR_TOOL_1
  The Maintainer sets a compact, heavy tool on the bench: a seal punch with a depth stop and a serialized collar.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / NARR_RECEIVE_1
  You receive an AMR tag, an AMR printout, and a scope-limited seal punch tool. The registry reader returns to its idle screen, satisfied in the way only a system can be when it has transferred responsibility.
- SCN-056 / SCN_056_SCHED_COUNTER / N00_TABLEAU
  A caged window marked SCHEDULING faces the corridor like a confession booth with forms.
  A “NO-SHOW RECOVERY” bin sits under the counter, sealed with a strip of tape that has been re-taped.
  A board of approved stamp substitutions hangs slightly crooked.
  A press labeled SLOT TOKEN—AUTHORIZED IMPRESSIONS ONLY is bolted to the laminate.
- SCN-056 / SCN_056_SCHED_COUNTER / N11_DENIAL_POISED
  The clerk’s pen is already poised, as if denial is a checkbox they practice.
- SCN-056 / SCN_056_SCHED_COUNTER / N41_RULE_GLASS
  The clerk taps the glass twice, as if the rule is physically stored in it.
- SCN-056 / SCN_056_SCHED_COUNTER / N50_LOOK_BIN
  A typed label: NO-SHOW RECOVERY — “MASS THAT FAILED TO ARRIVE” — VERIFY CUSTODY BEFORE IMPRESSION.
  The phrasing is old enough to have outlived whoever wrote it.
- SCN-056 / SCN_056_SCHED_COUNTER / N61_STAMPS_ASIDE
  Several substitution lines are crossed out and re-initialed, like grudges.
- SCN-056 / SCN_056_SCHED_COUNTER / N81_PRIORITY_KNUCKLES
  The clerk’s voice stays level; their knuckles whiten on the pen.
- SCN-056 / SCN_056_SCHED_COUNTER / N113_RULE_SETTLES
  The rule settles into place: time slots aren’t granted here. They’re taken, transferred, or recovered—then defended as property.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N00_TABLEAU
  A caged window marked SCHEDULING faces the corridor like a confession booth with forms.
  A “NO-SHOW RECOVERY” bin sits under the counter, sealed with tape that has been re-taped.
  A crooked board lists approved stamp substitutions.
  A press labeled SLOT TOKEN—AUTHORIZED IMPRESSIONS ONLY is bolted to the laminate.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N20_LOOK_BIN
  A typed label: NO-SHOW RECOVERY — “MASS THAT FAILED TO ARRIVE” — VERIFY CUSTODY BEFORE IMPRESSION.
  The phrasing is old enough to feel like policy instead of language.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N30_USE_BIN_OPEN
  The tape gives with a tired sound, like it’s done this before.
  Inside: a stack of thin blanks and a small, sealed sleeve marked RECOVERY—PENDING IMPRESSION.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N36_SLEEVE_TAKEN
  You take the sealed sleeve from the bin.
  It’s light, like it’s waiting to become real when someone stamps it.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N40_LOOK_PRESS
  The press is bolted down like it has tried to leave before.
  A placard beneath it: AUTHORIZED IMPRESSIONS ONLY. “AUTHORIZED” is underlined twice.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N40S_LOOK_PRESS
  The press is bolted down like it has tried to leave before.
  A placard beneath it: AUTHORIZED IMPRESSIONS ONLY. “AUTHORIZED” is underlined twice.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N42_PRESS_DESC
  The press handle is cold and over-maintained.
  The die face reads: CUSTODY IMPRESSION — VALID UNTIL CHALLENGED.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N45_IMPRESS_RESULT
  You align the sleeve, set the blank, and pull the handle in one motion.
  The token comes out with a clean impression and a serial that feels accusatory by design.
- SCN-057 / SCN_057_SLOT_TOKEN_RECOVERY / N90_LOOK_BOARD
  Approved stamp substitutions are listed in tidy rows.
  Several lines are crossed out and re-initialed, like grudges formalized.
  It reads like an admission that the system anticipates failure and calls it “process.”
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N00_TABLEAU
  The scheduling counter is a cage with glass and forms.
  A board labeled APPROVED STAMP SUBSTITUTIONS hangs slightly crooked, corners curled from being handled and put back.
  Several entries are crossed out and re-initialed, like corrections that needed witnesses.
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N10_READ_BOARD
  The entries are typed in tidy rows: REQUIRED STAMP → APPROVED SUBSTITUTE.
  A footer note reads: “SUBSTITUTIONS PRESERVE CHAIN CONTINUITY.”
  Someone underlined “continuity” hard enough to dent the laminate.
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N12_FIND_RELEVANT
  One line is newer than the rest—different ink in the initials:
  “UPSTREAM AUTHORIZATION — UNAVAILABLE → COMPLAINT ACKNOWLEDGMENT STAMP.”
  Next to it: “VALID FOR PROVISIONAL CLEARANCE PENDING REVIEW.”
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N52_NARRATOR_IMPLICATION
  The implication lands cleanly: a complaint stamp can stand in for missing authority, because the system treats “dispute, logged” as a form of custody.
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N29_NARRATOR_WORKAROUND
  You can feel the shape of the workaround: not an exception, a sanctioned reroute.
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N22_FINE_PRINT
  The fine print is mostly prohibitions.
  One sentence repeats in different wording: “SUBSTITUTIONS DO NOT CREATE RIGHTS.”
  Someone added a handwritten addendum: “THEY CREATE SURVIVABLE PACKETS.”
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N16_CROSSED_OUT
  Several substitutions are struck through and re-initialed.
  The pattern is consistent: anything that looked like mercy got removed. Anything that looked like documentation stayed.
- SCN-058 / SCN_058_STAMP_SUBSTITUTION_BOARD / N35_NARRATOR_NOTE
  You note the rule without moving anything yet: complaint acknowledgment can function as an approved substitute in the clearance chain.
- SCN-059 / SCN_059_IWO_CLEARANCE / N00_TABLEAU
  The scheduling counter is still a cage with glass and forms.
  The press, the substitution board, the no-show bin—nothing has moved.
  Only you have: an AMR that calls you “standing,” a TER that calls you “processable,” and a slot token that calls you “in custody.”
- SCN-059 / SCN_059_IWO_CLEARANCE / N33_LOOK_BOARD
  The substitution board hangs slightly crooked, corners curled from being handled and put back.
  Approved workarounds, formalized.
  It reads like a promise: the chain can tolerate reality, as long as reality is stamped.
- SCN-059 / SCN_059_IWO_CLEARANCE / N90_GIVE_TOKEN
  You slide the token into the tray.
  The clerk doesn’t pick it up at first—just looks at the impression like it might change its mind.
- SCN-059 / SCN_059_IWO_CLEARANCE / N92_CLERK_STAMPING
  Paper moves behind the glass.
  A stamp lands, lifts, lands again—measured, almost tender in its violence.
- SCN-059 / SCN_059_IWO_CLEARANCE / N94_PACKET_SLIDES
  A thick envelope slides through the lower slot, edges square, corners already worn by expectation.
  An extra insert rides with it—paper that doesn’t match the rest, folded like it was meant to be found later.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_START
  Interconnection Bay Staging: a bright, over-labeled room pretending it’s temporary.
  The AMR reader loop hums with the confidence of something that has never been cross-examined.
  A clipboard station sits under a sign that says PLEASE PRINT, as if handwriting is the primary hazard.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_NARR_LOOK_STATIONS
  Checkpoint dressed up as a work area: reader loop, dummy mass fixture, test load panel, and a clipboard station that looks like it’s never been cleaned without being photographed first.
  The supervisor doesn’t step in your way. They just stand where your options feel narrower.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_AMR_CLIPPED
  The tag seats with a small click.
  The loop chirps once—polite, like it’s acknowledging a witness, not a worker.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_DUMMY_SEATED
  You align the pins and lock the mass in place.
  The latch resists, then gives—like it’s deciding whether to cooperate.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_LOAD_SET
  You set the toggles to the posted profile.
  The panel vibrates faintly, like it’s clearing its throat.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_CLIP_INIT
  You initial in the box labeled TECH PRESENT.
  The paper absorbs it greedily, like it’s been hungry.
- SCN-060 / DG_STAGING_INTERCONNECTION_BAY / N_FINAL_CLEAR
  The staging indicators settle into a steady pattern that looks like calm if you don’t ask what it cost.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N001_INTRO
  Aperture Bay is lit like a loading dock that got promoted.
  
  The aperture is a mirror-surface circle set into a frame that insists it is just another piece of municipal infrastructure.
  
  A floor mark—RADIO SWEET-SPOT—is painted where your boots already are, as if the building is trying to keep you from wandering into interpretation.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N060_TUNE_PASS
  You press a thumb against the grille, adjust the angle by millimeters, and listen the way you listen for a bearing going bad.
  
  The hiss changes.
  
  Not a channel. Not a call. Just cleaner bleed—enough to confirm there is a world on the other side that would prefer not to be confirmed.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N061_TUNE_FAIL
  You try to coax clarity out of the grille. It gives you the same exhausted hiss.
  
  If there's a signal, it's not volunteering.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N100_APERTURE_DESC
  The surface reflects you with the accuracy of an inspection mirror.
  
  Then it reflects you from an angle you are not standing at.
  
  The frame has three sets of bolt heads with three different paint codes, like three different crews tried to agree without meeting.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N121_APERTURE_NORMAL_NARR
  The mirror does not answer.
  
  The bay’s status panel continues to display NORMAL OPERATION in a font that predates doubt.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N130_APERTURE_SEAM_NARR
  The seam is clean. Too clean.
  
  Someone has been here with solvent and a sense of liability.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N200_SHROUD_DESC
  The control shroud has a laminated label zip-tied to it like a confession that refuses to be stapled.
  
  It reads:
  
  “SPINDLE NODE INTERFACE — ALIGNMENT LOCK CONTROL”
  “CAUTION: DO NOT INTERRUPT LOCK WITHOUT ROUTING INSTRUMENTS”
  
  The word “routing” is underlined once, carefully, like it’s the only word anyone can defend.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N221_SHROUD_INSTRUMENTS_NARR
  The label does not list them.
  
  It assumes you already have them—or that you will be the instrument.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N230_SHROUD_TAG_NARR
  A brittle service tag hangs behind the shroud, dated in three different handwriting styles.
  
  The latest entry is a blank line with a signature box nobody used.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N300_SWEETSPOT_DESC
  The floor mark is a rectangle of yellow paint with a stenciled caption: RADIO SWEET-SPOT.
  
  Under the yellow are older outlines—two previous “sweet-spots,” shifted by inches, each crossed out with an X that looks angry for something so minor.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N321_SWEETSPOT_MOVE_NARR
  There’s no note. Just revisions.
  
  The building records location changes better than reasons.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N330_SWEETSPOT_SCUFF_NARR
  The heaviest scuffs are centered exactly where you’re standing.
  
  People stood here a lot, and not for comfort.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N340_SWEETSPOT_POSTURE_PASS
  You shift your boots until they align with the oldest outline under the yellow.
  
  The bay’s quiet changes—subtle, like a system admitting you found the intended place to be.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N341_SWEETSPOT_POSTURE_FAIL
  You adjust, then adjust again.
  
  Nothing rewards you. The paint keeps its secrets.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N400_CHUTE_DESC
  The outgoing packet chute is labeled like a mailbox that resents being called a mailbox.
  
  A stack of thin routing slips sits in the throat—pre-punched, pre-numbered, pre-justified.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N420_CHUTE_LASTSLIP_NARR
  The last slip is stamped twice, as if the first stamp wasn’t brave enough.
  
  DESTINATION: OVERFLOW INTAKE
  CLASS: TEMPORARY HOLD
  REASON: CAPACITY MANAGEMENT
  
  The word “temporary” is doing most of the work.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N431_CHUTE_FEED_NARR
  The chute accepts the slip without resistance.
  
  That is either good design or a willingness to take anything as long as it’s formatted.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N480_CONFIRM_INTRO
  The control recess waits under the shroud: a slot that looks like it was designed for a token, not a hand.
  
  If you do this, you do it as maintenance. You do it with a paper trail. You do it without inventing verbs you can’t defend.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N590_NO_TOKEN
  You reach for the recess and stop.
  
  Without the slot token, this isn’t a procedure. It’s a story.
  
  The bay offers you no help writing it.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N501_COMMIT_NARR
  You seat the slot token in the control recess. It clicks like a stamp finding its ink.
  
  The aperture’s surface tightens—subtle, like a muscle remembering it has a job.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N510_RADIO_BLEED
  A thin speaker grille above the bay hisses to life.
  
  Not a clean channel. Not even a proper call. Just bleed-through—Earth-side radio fragments caught in the alignment.
- SCN-061 / DG_SCN061_APERTURE_BAY_MIRROR_SURFACE / N517_CUT
  The radio cuts mid-sentence, like someone pulled a plug to prevent a precedent.
  
  The mirror-surface aperture loses your reflection first.
  
  Then it loses the room.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_ENTER
  The SPINDLE Chamber Floor smells like cold dust and warmed insulation.
  The containment sphere sits in its cradle, matte and over-insulated—
  then, for a fraction of a second, it isn’t.
  The surface flickers reflective, like a mirror that would prefer a different room.
  The floor signage still reads NORMAL OPERATIONS, which is either optimism or fraud.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SPHERE_INTRO
  Up close, the sphere is mostly matte—industrial, honest, designed to be ignored.
  Then it catches the room wrong. The reflection isn’t you from any angle you can stand in.
  It flickers back to matte before your eyes finish reporting it.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_STATUS_INTRO
  The status indicator cluster is lit with careful colors: greens that mean “allowed,” ambers that mean “pending,” reds that mean “someone else’s problem.”
  One amber lamp is labeled in a different font: HOLD / NON-LOCAL.
  The label looks like it arrived already archived.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_STATUS_READ_NARR
  The printed tag list is half facility jargon, half something that pretends to be facility jargon.
  STANDING INDICATOR: UNKNOWN.
  SERVICE CLASS: UNRESOLVED.
  The rest is ordinary, which is how it hides.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SCAN_INTRO
  The interface scan panel is a waist-high slab of glass with a keypad that assumes obedience.
  Its prompt is cheerful in the way compliance software is cheerful:
  ENTER TARGET / SELECT FORM / SUBMIT.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SCAN_RESULT
  The panel chirps once, pleased with itself.
  A line prints across the screen as if it’s always been there:
  NOTICE: UNAUTHORIZED LOAD DETECTED.
  ORIGIN NODE: SOL-EARTH-LOCAL.
  MANAGING AUTHORITY: METASTABLE TRANSFER AUTHORITY (MTA).
  ACTION: HOLD STATE PENDING COMPLIANCE.
  REFERENCE: [a number that looks too clean to be local].
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_REF_EXPAND_NARR
  You expand the reference field.
  The digits reflow to fit, like the system was waiting for permission to be specific.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_REF_INTERPRET_PASS
  The reference string is structured like an external docket: prefix, jurisdiction stub, and a queue-like suffix.
  It’s designed to be cited, not understood.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_REF_INTERPRET_FAIL
  You can’t place the format with confidence.
  It’s too clean, too standardized—like it expects your systems to already agree with it.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PRINT_NOTICE_NARR
  The nearby printer wakes like it’s been pretending not to exist.
  A dot-matrix page tears out, barcodes crisp enough to feel insulting.
  The header reads like a contractor letter until you get to MTA.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PULL_LAST_NARR
  The panel scrolls a short list of messages.
  Most are dull: filter changes, lubrication intervals, overdue inspections.
  One entry is not dull. It is precise.
  HOLD — NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE — PENDING DOCUMENTATION — MTA REF [the same too-clean number].
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PRESENCE_NARR
  The panel accepts the note without celebrating.
  A confirmation code appears, then immediately asks if you want a hard copy.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PRINT_CONFIRM_NARR
  The printer produces a thin receipt that looks like nothing.
  The kind of nothing that wins arguments.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_ESTOP_INTRO
  The emergency stop is a red mushroom button under a clear flip cover.
  The cover is scuffed from hands that stopped just short of being responsible.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_ESTOP_PLACARD_NARR
  The placard reads: EMERGENCY STOP — USE ONLY TO PREVENT IMMINENT HARM.
  Below that, in smaller print: ACTIVATION REQUIRES POST-EVENT REPORT.
  Someone underlined REPORT twice.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_COMMIT_NARR
  You don’t fix the hold. You make it legible.
  You print the notice. You capture the reference number. You create a timestamped chain that says you were here, and you saw it, and you did not improvise alone.
  The sphere flickers once more—mirror, matte—like it’s being kept open on purpose.
  The room accepts your paperwork the way it accepts power: without gratitude.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_LEAVE_OBS_LINE
  You step toward the stairs down to the Observation Deck.
  Behind you, the sphere keeps its own time, interrupting your vision like a clerical correction.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_LEAVE_OVERFLOW_LINE
  You angle toward the Overflow Intake Concourse.
  The chamber stays behind glass and signage, still insisting—quietly—that someone should be on record.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N0_INTRO_1
  The Control Room smells like hot dust and laminated paper. The main console is awake. The alarms are quiet in the way a system gets quiet when it has learned you’re in charge.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N1_INTRO_2
  A stack of notices sits under a magnet that says OLEA FACILITIES ARE BORING. The notices are not from OLEA.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N5_NOTICES_1
  The top sheet is titled NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE ADVISORY, printed on thick stock that pretends to be municipal. The letterhead is a clean acronym you don’t recognize. The date predates most of the binder downstairs.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N6_NOTICES_2
  Someone has underlined “COMPARABILITY REQUIREMENT” three times, like the ink itself needed oversight.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N7_NOTICES_3
  You can file it, ignore it, or treat it as evidence later. The room does not care.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N10_CONSOLE_TOUCH
  When you touch the console lip, the speaker clicks. A polite tone that implies it was already listening.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N30_ALARM_DESC_1
  The alarm panel is an antique grid of labeled lights. Half the labels have been replaced by tape that insists it was always official.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N31_ALARM_DESC_2
  One amber indicator reads: “INTERLOCK STATUS: AMBIGUOUS.” It is on.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N34_ALARM_NO_DETAIL
  The panel offers no further detail. The ambiguity is apparently a completed state.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N37_ALARM_ACK_RESULT
  You press ACK. The amber light goes from steady to steady, but now it’s the steadiness of something that can say it was acknowledged.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N20_BINDER_DESC_1
  The procedure binder is swollen with addenda. Someone has re-tabbed it three times, like the binder itself kept failing inspections.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N21_BINDER_DESC_2
  The shutdown sequence is present. The definitions section has been stapled over with a “temporary clarification” that looks permanent.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N23_DEFINITIONS_1
  The definitions page defines “presence” as “verifiable occupancy within the operational envelope.” Someone circled “verifiable” and wrote: PRINT.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N25_SHUTDOWN_1
  The shutdown sequence begins with three steps of “Confirm,” then a step of “Notify,” then a step of “Confirm” that you notified. The last page is missing, replaced with a sheet titled “Cross-Jurisdictional Coordination (Do Not Execute Without Authority).”
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N40_PRINTER_DESC_1
  The log printer tray sits under the console like a forgotten organ. The paper is already loaded, which feels like someone else’s decision.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N41_PRINTER_DESC_2
  A green button reads PRINT BASELINE. Under it, in smaller type: “For presence verification and incident neutrality.”
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N43_PRINTING_1
  The printer wakes with a dry, offended rattle. The room’s status scrolls onto paper with timestamps that do not care who asked.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N45_PRINTING_2
  The first page lands warm. It lists rotational frame rates, load draw, and an “external coordination flag” marked ACTIVE, as if that’s normal.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N47_PRINTING_3
  The printer keeps humming like it expects you to do something that will require an explanation.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N90_LEAVE_CORRIDOR_1
  You step toward the corridor. The Control Room stays lit behind you, as if it’s keeping your seat warm for the report.
- SCN-063 / SCN_063_CONTROL_ROOM_LOGGING / N91_LEAVE_DECK_1
  You angle toward the observation deck access. The console fan sound follows for a beat longer than it should.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N0_INTRO1
  The log printer tray holds a single fresh sheet, still warm at the edge.
  Black dot-matrix ink. Crisp timestamp.
  It looks boring enough to survive a meeting.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N1_INTRO2
  The header reads: “CONTROL ROOM EVENT LOG — CONTINUOUS OUTPUT.”
  A footer line repeats in small type: “NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE NOTICE: RETAIN FOR COMPARABILITY.”
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N10_LOOK1
  You scan the top third. The timestamp is precise to the second.
  The entry is plain enough to be weaponized later.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N11_LOOK2
  Lines include:
  - “SHIFT STATUS: UNATTENDED — CONTINUITY MODE”
  - “OPERATOR PRESENCE: NOT REQUIRED”
  - “CONSOLE INTERACTION: REGISTERED”
  And, again, the footer: “NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE NOTICE: RETAIN FOR COMPARABILITY.”
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N20_ASK1
  A soft mechanical clack answers you: the printer advances a fraction, as if to demonstrate compliance.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N21_ASK_FOOTER1
  [PRINTER FOOTER TEXT]
  “CONTINUOUS OUTPUT IS A RETENTION FEATURE.
  DISCONTINUOUS OUTPUT CREATES GAPS.
  GAPS CREATE QUESTIONS.”
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N23_ASK_FOOTER2
  [PRINTER FOOTER TEXT]
  “QUESTIONS ARE NON-LOCAL.
  THIS FORMAT IS COMPARABLE.”
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N24_ASK_WRAP
  The sheet sits there, pretending not to be an argument.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N25_NONLOCAL1
  [PRINTER FOOTER TEXT]
  “NON-LOCAL: OUTSIDE THE RESPONSIBLE WORKGROUP.
  WORKGROUP: SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
  NOTICE: PROVIDED HEREBY.”
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N27_FOOTER_NEWREC
  [PRINTER FOOTER TEXT]
  “ANSWERING CREATES A NEW RECORD.
  NEW RECORDS REQUIRE A FRAMEWORK.”
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N28_NARRATOR_QUIET
  The printer goes quiet, decisively, like it has concluded the conversation correctly.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N50_STEPBACK1
  You let the page sit in the tray, accumulating legitimacy without you.
  The printer hums faintly, like it’s keeping time out of spite.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N30_TAKE1
  You pinch the perforation and lift. The paper separates with a dry tear that sounds louder than it should.
  For a moment, you feel almost grateful it’s physical.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N31_TAKE2
  The timestamp is legible. The ink doesn’t smear.
  It will fit in a binder without you having to explain why it’s weird.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N33_TAKE3
  You fold it once, on purpose, and keep it.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N40_TAKE_OLEA1
  You take it the way you were trained to take evidence you’re not calling evidence.
  Clean tear. No flourish. Just a record moving from tray to custody.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N41_TAKE_OLEA2
  The footer’s “NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE” line looks wrong for OLEA templates.
  You don’t react to it. That’s the point.
- SCN-064 / DG_SCN_064_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N43_NARRATOR_KEEP
  You fold it once and keep it.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ENTER
  The records hallway is built to erase urgency. Beige paint, metal frames, soft-close doors that keep arguments inside.
  
  The pneumatic tube station doesn’t match that philosophy. Its indicator lamp is lit—steady, patient—like it’s been waiting to be acknowledged.
  
  In the receiver tray: a dot-matrix printout, still curled from the rollers.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LOOK_TUBE
  The tube station is older than the hallway signage and newer than the building’s optimism.
  
  A laminated label reads: RECEIPTS ARE RECORDS. DO NOT DISCARD.
  Below it, someone has added pen: “Unless it’s not ours.”
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LOOK_PRINT
  The paper is too clean. The perforated edges are intact.
  The header is centered, as if the sender expects to be filed.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LOOK_PRINT_TAG
  There’s a barcode block that looks printed by a different decade than the dot-matrix text. It’s crisp enough to feel like an accusation.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_STANDING_NARR
  The notice includes a definition in the margin, like it’s tired of being questioned.
  
  “Standing: recognized eligibility to be processed.”
  “Processed” is underlined once. The underline is perfectly straight, which is its own kind of threat.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_SERVICE_NARR
  Another margin block, pre-emptive.
  
  “SERVICE CLASS: UNRESOLVED.”
  “Incorrect service class assignments may affect standing.”
  
  The sentence is written like an apology that learned to protect itself.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_SHOW_REF_NARR
  Saying it out loud makes it feel more real and less defensible.
  
  The reference string has the shape of an external docket: prefix, jurisdiction stub, and a queue-like tail that implies you are not first.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_INTERPRET_REF_PASS
  It reads like external docketing: jurisdiction stub, a processing lane code, then a queue-position tail. It’s designed to be cited, not understood.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_INTERPRET_REF_FAIL
  You can’t place it with confidence. It’s too clean, too standardized—like it expects your systems to already agree with it.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LOOK_BARCODE
  High-contrast and machine-friendly. No smearing. No aging.
  
  It’s formatted like it expects every reader you own to already agree what it means.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LOOK_RECORDS
  The records door has three locks and a posted schedule.
  The schedule is handwritten, then photocopied until it becomes law.
  
  Someone has added: “NO TUBE DROPS INSIDE RECORDS.”
  Under that: “Exception: Compliance.”
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LOOK_FAX
  A placard above the wall fax lists numbers by jurisdiction, as if geography still solves things.
  
  There’s a blank line labeled “NON-LOCAL / OTHER.” The blank line has been used often enough to be glossy.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ASK_MTA_FAX_NARR
  The placard doesn’t answer. It offers a procedure instead.
  
  “If destination is unlisted: transmit to ADMIN SERVICES. NOTE ‘NON-LOCAL’ IN COVER SHEET.”
  
  The instruction feels like it was written after someone tried to be clever.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LOOK_FIRE
  The fire panel has a taped note in block letters: “DO NOT SILENCE WITHOUT INCIDENT NUMBER.”
  Beneath it, in smaller writing: “Even if it’s annoying.”
  
  The building’s priorities are clear.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ASK_WHO_SENT_NARR
  The printout answers the way authorities do—by naming a category instead of a person.
  
  “MANAGING AUTHORITY: METASTABLE TRANSFER AUTHORITY (MTA).”
  
  No signature. No phone tree. Just an acronym that expects compliance to be its own point of contact.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_TAKE_PRINTOUT
  You lift the page from the tray. The paper resists, then releases, like it wants to be on record.
  
  The tube station light stays lit. It doesn’t thank you. It just waits for the next step you didn’t agree to.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ACCEPT_INTRO
  You treat it as evidence, not mail.
  You keep the original. You note the header. You keep the barcodes intact.
  You do not summarize from memory.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ACCEPT_INITIAL_OLEA_LINE
  You add OLEA signatory initials in the margin, small and boring.
  A chain of custody is mostly handwriting that refuses to be interesting.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ACCEPT_INITIAL_PASS
  You add initials and a timestamp in the margin—nothing authoritative, just consistent.
  It reads like a person who expects to be questioned and intends to survive it.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ACCEPT_INITIAL_FAIL
  You start to write, then stop.
  Without standing to claim, handwriting is just another thing that can be argued about later.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ACCEPT_NO_INITIAL_LINE
  You don’t initial it. You still handle it like it will be read aloud later, by someone paid to misunderstand you.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_ACCEPT_RESOLVE
  The reference number—MTA_NOTICE_REF—becomes something you can cite without sounding like you made it up.
  
  The tube station indicator finally clicks off. Not resolved. Just recorded.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LEAVE_DOWN_LINE
  You head down toward the Admin Lobby and Kiosk.
  The hallway swallows the tube station’s patience without argument.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LEAVE_RIGHT_LINE
  You turn toward the Copy and Fax Room.
  Machines that replicate paper also replicate blame. You go anyway.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LEAVE_FORWARD_LINE
  You move toward the Operations Corridor.
  Somewhere behind you, the tube station stays quiet—like it has done its part and is waiting to see if you do yours.
- SCN-065 / DG_SCN_065_MTA_NOTICE / N_LEAVE_LEFT_LINE
  You head left toward the SPINDLE observation deck.
  The notice remains what it is: a hold state dressed up as administrative routine.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_ENTER
  The Non-Local Compliance Notices Room hasn’t changed.
  You have.
  
  Forms racks sag under misfit templates. An envelope stack waits for hands that never arrive.
  And the clipped notice—its barcode too clean—now matches something you already logged.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_FORMS_INTRO
  The rack starts in local language—Retention, Posting, Public Notice—
  then switches to templates that assume a different court system.
  
  The headers repeat like a chant:
  “Standing Indicator.”
  “Service Class.”
  “Queue Position.”
  
  The phrasing is tight in the way remote offices get tight when they’ve been sued.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_FORMS_FOOTER
  The footer isn’t a signature. It’s an origin story pretending not to be one:
  “Managing Authority:” and then a blank where a name should be,
  replaced by a barcode block in the same high-contrast geometry as the clipped notice.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_FORMS_COMPARE_NARR
  The angles match. The spacing matches.
  The form isn’t “non-local” in the abstract.
  It’s from the same system that issued the HOLD.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_FORMS_STANDING_FOOTNOTE
  There’s no one here to answer.
  The template answers anyway, in a footnote written like it resents the question:
  
  “Standing: recognized eligibility to be processed.”
  “Processed” is underlined once—perfectly straight, like a machine did it to win an argument.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_FORMS_SKIM
  You skim until the sentences stop being local. Then you stop.
  The forms go back into the rack like they were never out.
  That is, technically, how systems survive.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_ENV_INTRO
  Pre-addressed envelopes. Windowed. Uniform weight.
  Most carry bland routing marks—approved for travel through a system you don’t see.
  
  A few have the same too-clean barcode format.
  They’re sealed with a pressure strip that assumes speed, and assumes you’ll comply with it.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_ENV_POCKET_NARR
  You take one without ceremony.
  It feels like taking a blank form: harmless until someone decides it wasn’t.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_ENV_ROUTING_NARR
  The routing marks aren’t municipal. They’re docket logic.
  Lane codes. Queue markers.
  A bureaucracy that measures time as “not yet.”
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_NOTICE_INTRO
  The notice uses local nouns—facility, operator, responsible party—
  but the verbs are wrong.
  Not “must comply.”
  “Will be held.”
  
  The barcode is pristine. No smearing. No aging.
  Like it arrived already archived.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_NOTICE_BODY
  You read the first lines twice because they’re trying not to be accusatory.
  “NOTICE: Non-local compliance condition detected.”
  “Action: Hold state pending documentation.”
  “Incorrect service class assignments may affect standing.”
  
  It’s the same tone as the tube printout.
  Bland enough to pretend it’s routine.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_NOTICE_COMPARE
  The reference field on the wall notice is half-obscured by copy quality.
  But the barcode block isn’t.
  
  The format matches what you already logged.
  This room isn’t full of “miscellaneous compliance.”
  It’s a spillover tray.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_NOTICE_VARIANCE_PROCEDURE
  The notice doesn’t answer questions.
  It offers procedures instead, in smaller print at the bottom:
  “Temporary Operating Variance available upon determination of service class and standing.”
  
  Like permission is a product you can request.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_REINTERPRET_NARR
  You stop treating the posting as “generic.”
  You read it like an MTA form: identify the lane, locate the exception, extract the language that makes “held” negotiable.
  
  Behind the clipped notice, a thin packet is tucked the way offices tuck anything they don’t want to explain.
  “TEMPorary Operating Variance — TEMPLATE.”
  
  It’s written to be filled by someone who knows not to sound surprised.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_IDENTIFY_PASS
  The header structure resolves into a family: docket lane, standing gate, then a variance carve-out designed to be cited.
  It isn’t “a template.”
  It’s an upstream permission format that expects to be filed against a HOLD.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_IDENTIFY_FAIL
  You can place the tone and the geometry, but not the exact family.
  It’s standardized on purpose.
  You don’t get to be certain without joining the queue that created it.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_SIGNATORY_NARR
  You translate the headings into the most defensible language you know: claims of presence, claims of custody, claims that can survive being read aloud.
  The template doesn’t become friendly.
  It becomes usable.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_MEMORIZE_NARR
  You memorize the headings, because possession is a kind of commitment.
  But you also know memory isn’t admissible.
  Not when paper exists.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_TAKE_TEMPLATE_NARR
  You remove the template from the stack.
  The clipped notice stays behind, still pretending it’s local.
  The template does not pretend.
  It assumes an upstream reader.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_LEAVE_LOBBY_LINE
  You leave the notices where they are.
  The door shuts with the soft finality of an office that expects paper to outlive people.
- SCN-066 / DG_SCN_066_NOTICES_REINTERPRET / N_LEAVE_COPYFAX_LINE
  You step out toward the machines that turn originals into liabilities.
  Behind you, the clipped notice stays perfectly legible.
  Like it’s been waiting to be recognized.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ENTER
  The SPINDLE Chamber Floor smells like cold dust and warmed insulation.
  The containment sphere sits in its cradle, matte and over-insulated—
  then, for a fraction of a second, it isn’t.
  The surface flickers reflective, like a surface filing itself under a different room.
  
  The interface scan panel waits with a polite prompt that assumes you’ll cooperate.
  A label on the frame reads: SUBMISSIONS BECOME RECORD.
  Someone has added, in pen: “Especially the wrong ones.”
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SPHERE_INTRO
  Up close, the sphere is mostly matte—industrial, honest, designed to be ignored.
  Then it catches the room wrong. The reflection doesn’t resolve into any angle you’re standing in.
  It flickers back to matte before your eyes finish reporting it.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SPHERE_BEAT
  The sphere flickers once more, like a clerical correction applied to light.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_STATUS_INTRO
  The status indicator cluster is lit with careful colors: greens that mean allowed, ambers that mean pending.
  One amber lamp is labeled in a different font: HOLD / NON-LOCAL.
  Beneath it, a printed tag list includes: STANDING INDICATOR: UNKNOWN. SERVICE CLASS: UNRESOLVED.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_STATUS_READ_NARR
  The labels don’t change when you stare at them. They just become more official.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ESTOP_INTRO
  The emergency stop is a red mushroom button under a clear flip cover.
  The cover is scuffed from hands that stopped just short of being responsible.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ESTOP_PLACARD_NARR
  The placard reads: USE ONLY TO PREVENT IMMINENT HARM.
  Below it: ACTIVATION REQUIRES POST-EVENT REPORT.
  Someone underlined REPORT twice.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SCAN_INTRO
  The interface scan panel is a waist-high slab of glass with a keypad that assumes obedience.
  Its prompt is cheerful in the way compliance software is cheerful: SELECT FORM / SUBMIT.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SCAN_NARR_LIST
  The panel offers a short list. One entry is already highlighted, like it’s been waiting for you:
  TEMPORARY OPERATING VARIANCE — HOLD CONDITION (NON-LOCAL).
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_REQUIRED_FIELDS
  Required fields populate in an unfriendly order:
  SUBJECT NODE (prefilled: SOL-EARTH-LOCAL)
  HOLD REFERENCE (blank)
  SERVICE CLASS (unresolved)
  STANDING INDICATOR (unknown)
  REQUESTED ACTION (prefilled: TEMPORARY OPERATING VARIANCE)
  
  A final checkbox blinks:
  ACKNOWLEDGE: SUBMISSION MAY AFFECT STANDING.
  Your hands stay steady anyway.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ATTACH_REF_NARR
  The panel accepts the string too quickly, like it wanted to believe you.
  A secondary field appears: QUEUE POSITION (READ-ONLY).
  It remains blank, which is its own kind of answer.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_INTERPRET_REF_PASS
  The reference string resolves into an external docket shape: prefix, jurisdiction stub, lane code, then a queue tail.
  It’s designed to be cited, not understood.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_INTERPRET_REF_FAIL
  You can’t place it with confidence. It’s too clean, too standardized—like it expects your systems to already agree with it.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SIGNATORY_NARR
  The panel adds a line item: PRESENCE ATTESTATION — RECEIVED.
  It does not say accepted. It says received, like it’s protecting itself.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_LOAD_TEMPLATE
  You place the variance template against the glass, not because it needs to “see” paper—
  because you want the act recorded as procedural, not improvised.
  
  The panel chirps once, pleased with itself.
  The form renders with fields mapped into non-local language.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_PREVIEW_SUMMARY
  The summary reads like it’s been written by a distant office that hates adjectives:
  REQUEST: Temporary Operating Variance
  CONDITION: HOLD — NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE
  SUBJECT NODE: SOL-EARTH-LOCAL
  SERVICE CLASS: UNRESOLVED (PENDING)
  STANDING: UNKNOWN (PENDING)
  ATTACHMENTS: [template]
  
  A small note at the bottom adds, defensively:
  PROCESSING ORDER DETERMINED BY QUEUE POSITION.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_BACK_OUT_NARR
  You step away from the panel.
  The prompt stays cheerful. It doesn’t care about your timing.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SUBMIT_AS_WRITTEN_NARR
  You submit the packet without dressing it up.
  No motives. No theories. Just fields filled enough to become someone else’s problem.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SUBMIT_WITH_NOTE_NARR
  You add one sentence. Clinical. Time-stamped.
  “Reflective behavior ongoing.”
  Not because it will help them understand—because it proves you saw it and didn’t rename it.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SUBMIT_RECEIVED
  The panel pauses—long enough to feel like judgment, short enough to remain deniable.
  Then:
  SUBMISSION RECEIVED. STATUS: PROCESSING.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SUBMIT_RECEIVED_NOTE
  The panel pauses—long enough to feel like judgment, short enough to remain deniable.
  Then:
  SUBMISSION RECEIVED. STATUS: PROCESSING.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ACK_PRINT
  A printer inside the panel wakes and feeds out a thin slip with a clean barcode.
  The header reads: MTA — VARIANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT (TEMPORARY).
  Beneath it: HOLD REMAINS IN EFFECT DURING PROCESSING.
  And, like a kindness that isn’t one: PROCESSING WINDOW GRANTED. DO NOT ALTER SUBJECT STATE.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_OUTRO
  The sphere flickers reflective again—mirror, matte—like it’s being kept open on purpose.
  The acknowledgment slip is warm from the printer.
  Warmth is not reassurance. It’s just heat.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ACK_PRINT_NOTE
  A printer inside the panel wakes and feeds out a thin slip with a clean barcode.
  The header reads: MTA — VARIANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT (TEMPORARY).
  Beneath it: HOLD REMAINS IN EFFECT DURING PROCESSING.
  A smaller line adds: CONDITION NOTE RECORDED (NON-DISPOSITIVE).
  It’s bureaucratic for “we heard you and it changes nothing.”
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_DUPLICATE_PRINT_NARR
  The panel prints a duplicate without comment.
  Paper has weight. That’s why it matters.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_OUTRO_NOTE
  The sphere flickers again—reflective, matte—like it resents being described.
  You pocket the slips anyway, turning delay into something you can cite.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_LEAVE_OBS_LINE
  You step toward the stairs down to the Observation Deck.
  Behind you, the sphere keeps its own time, interrupting your vision like a clerical correction.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_LEAVE_OVERFLOW_LINE
  You angle toward the Overflow Intake Concourse.
  The chamber stays behind glass and signage, still insisting—quietly—that someone should be on record.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_START
  The Records door has a newer seal over an older one.
  Someone replaced the rule without removing the evidence of the old rule.
  There’s a narrow window, a slot, and a chain-of-custody placard that looks recently wiped.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_LOOK_1
  The placard lists three ways to be denied, and none of them are “wrong.”
  A thin strip of adhesive still holds lint like it’s trying to preserve a timeline.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_LOOK_3
  The slot is labeled: SUBMIT IDENTIFIERS ONLY.
  Someone scratched “NO QUESTIONS” into the corner and then tried to buff it off.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_PRES_3
  The clerk’s pen pauses mid-air, just long enough to be noticed.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_REQ_3
  The clerk taps the counter twice, like they can wake the correct form up.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_SHOW_BOTH_3
  The clerk sets out a form like it was waiting under the counter the whole time.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_PERSUADE_3
  The clerk’s shoulders drop a fraction, as if “authority” is a contagious liability.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_COMMIT_3
  Paper moves through the slot in three clipped bundles, like the building is exhaling receipts.
  Each packet is stamped in a color that looks defensive.
- SCN-068 / SCN068_RECORDS_ACCESS / N_COMMIT_5
  You take:
  - Billing ledgers with charges that don’t match municipal templates.
  - Maintenance schedules listing crews from elsewhere, routed through codes you’ve only seen on the notice.
  - Audit flags dated before the “incident,” written like someone tried to warn a future reader without sounding like a person.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_START_01
  The Copy and Fax Room smells like warm plastic and old toner.
  The copier’s control panel is lit, patient, and already disappointed in you.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_START_02
  You have the records evidence.
  What you don’t have is a packet someone else can sign without becoming a story.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_PANEL_01
  The screen offers three big buttons: COPY, SCAN, and “COMPLIANCE DUPLICATION (LEGACY).”
  Under them, a smaller note: “DO NOT CREATE NEW INFORMATION.”
  Someone has underlined it hard enough to dent the plastic.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_PANEL_02
  The copier beeps once—an opinion.
  On-screen: “SELECT SOURCE MATERIAL.”
  Below that: “ORIGINALS ONLY.”
  Below that, smaller: “DO NOT FEED ORIGINALS.”
  
  A problem designed by committee, maintained by habit.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_PANEL_03
  It waits for a choice like an auditor.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_WHICH_01
  The copier does not answer questions.
  It waits for a choice like an auditor who already wrote the finding.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_STICKERS_01
  A neat stack of peel-off stickers: SERVICE ACCESS / CALIBRATION / AUDIT OVERRIDE (EXPIRED).
  They’re numbered in a way that implies a calendar you are not invited to see.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_FAXTRAY_01
  The fax tray holds a single curled confirmation page from years ago.
  It reads: “TRANSMISSION PARTIAL — RECEIPT SUCCESSFUL.”
  Someone circled “SUCCESSFUL” like it won an argument.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_SHELF_01
  Three-ring binders, divider tabs, and a label maker with the tape compartment open.
  There are exactly two fonts available: “OFFICIAL” and “OFFICIAL (CONDENSED).”
  The second one looks nervous.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_CHECKLIST_01
  A laminated checklist hangs beside the panel, edges browned from fluorescent light.
  Line 4 reads: “Cross-check identifiers, dates, and recurring charges.”
  Line 5 reads: “Do not editorialize. Editorialization is discoverable.”
  
  In pen, someone added: “If it feels like a story, it isn’t evidence.”
  The handwriting gets smaller on the last words, like it’s trying not to be quoted.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_TEST_01
  You feed a blank sheet. Your hand hesitates for no reason you’d put in writing.
  The machine pulls it in like it’s taking custody.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_TEST_02
  It prints: “TEST PAGE — NOT RECORD.”
  In the corner: a timestamp accurate to the second, as if daring you to dispute it.
  
  The copier is warmed up. The room is, too, in its own quiet way.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_SERVICE_DENIED_01
  The panel requests an authorization code you do not possess.
  It offers a helpful explanation: “UNAUTHORIZED USE CREATES DISCOVERABLE INTENT.”
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPLIANCE_01
  You peel a SERVICE ACCESS sticker. The adhesive resists, personally.
  The panel accepts the code without gratitude.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPLIANCE_02
  New options appear: “WATERMARK: WORKING COPY,” “AUTO-REDACT PERSONAL,” “MATCH LEDGER FORMAT.”
  None of them are about truth. All of them are about survivability.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_TESTC_01
  In compliance mode, even a blank page feels like a form.
  The machine prints: “TEST PAGE — NOT RECORD,” then adds a subtle watermark you didn’t ask for.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPILE_CAREFUL_STD_01
  You lay out the records evidence and build a packet that can’t be argued with easily.
  Identifiers. Dates. Recurring charges.
  The same numbers showing up where they shouldn’t.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPILE_FAST_STD_01
  You accept the defaults and start feeding the machine what it wants.
  If anything is wrong, it will be wrong in a standard way.
  Sometimes that passes as defensible.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPILE_CAREFUL_COMP_01
  You let compliance mode format the output, but you don’t let it think for you.
  You verify every identifier, every date, every repeating charge.
  Survivability without improvisation.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPILE_FAST_COMP_01
  You let compliance mode decide.
  It watermarks what it can, redacts what it thinks is personal, and aligns everything to the ledger’s idea of reality.
  It’s not truth. It’s presentation with guardrails.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPILE_PRINT_01
  The copier pulls page after page, stamping the corner with a bland, official certainty.
  The sound is steady.
  Your jaw isn’t.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_COMPILE_PRINT_02
  A divider tab prints last: “EVIDENCE PACKET — RECORDS.”
  The label maker chooses “OFFICIAL (CONDENSED)” without asking.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_OUTCOME_CONFIRM_01
  The section is compiled, hole-punched, and binder-ready.
  You can almost hear someone else agreeing with it later, because it’s easier than disagreeing.
  
  You stop one step short of calling it complete.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_FAX_01
  You lift the handset and feed the first page like you’re making a backup of your own conscience.
  The machine whines.
  
  The tray spits a status slip that manages to be both reassuring and useless:
  “TRANSMISSION PARTIAL — RECEIPT SUCCESSFUL.”
  
  You didn’t create redundancy.
  You created another version of events.
- SCN-069 / DG_SCN069_COPIER_EVIDENCE_PACKET / N_LEAVE_01
  You step back. The copier’s screen stays lit, like it’s keeping your place in line.
  The room does not forget unfinished tasks.
  
  Nothing is compiled. Nothing is defensible yet.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_START
  The conference room smells like dry toner and old coffee that no one admits to making.
  An EAC Finding Slip sits in the printer tray, face-up, as if waiting to be countersigned.
  The checklist folder is open to “RETIREMENT — SEQUENCE CONFIRMATION.”
  The whiteboard reduces the facility to three boxes and a fiscal cutoff date.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_START_2
  You have the Evidence Packet compiled.
  What you don’t have is a sentence that survives other people.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_START_3
  On the table: a memo template titled AUTHORIZED CLOSURE PATH — NARROW PURPOSE.
  Cursor blinking. No witnesses. Yet.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_REVIEW_1
  You pull the EAC Finding Slip from the tray. The header is stamped, not signed.
  A checklist corner is dog-eared where someone hesitated at the word “confirm.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_REVIEW_2
  On the whiteboard, someone wrote:
  “DON’T NAME IT.
  DON’T IMPROVE IT.
  DO CLOSE IT.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_REVIEW_3
  The memo template waits like it’s already been filed.
  You return to the draft.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_BORING_N1
  You type as if the memo is a receipt.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_BORING_N2
  A paragraph forms: dates, checklist references, attachment names.
  The device becomes “asset,” the behavior becomes “operational state,” the risk becomes “liability closure.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_DEF_N1
  You rewrite verbs first. The facts can wait.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_DEF_N2
  The paragraph becomes a corridor with handrails: narrow, continuous, hard to misread.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_STABLE_N1
  You start writing like a dispatcher is going to read it aloud.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_STABLE_N2
  You insert timestamps, action identifiers, and a sentence that reads like a promise without calling itself one.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_COMP_N1
  You pull notice numbers from the Evidence Packet and treat them like scripture.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_COMP_N2
  You write a paragraph that describes compliance as if it’s weather: present, documented, and not up for debate.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_CLAUSE_ADD_N1
  You add one sentence that looks harmless until it isn’t:
  “Interpretation is limited to the attached Evidence Packet; no additional inferences are intended or authorized.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_CLAUSE_FAIL_1
  You can write it, but you can’t make it stick.
  Without standing, that clause reads like you’re trying to bind someone else’s interpretation—and it will be treated as overreach.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_CLAUSE_SKIP_1
  You keep it lean. Lean memos travel faster. They also get rewritten by other people.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_END_DONT_PRINT
  You leave the cursor blinking.
  Unfiled work has a way of becoming someone else’s version of events.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_END_NOTYET
  You step away from the table.
  The template stays open, patient and unpaid.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_PRINT_N1
  The printer wakes with a complaint disguised as a warm-up cycle.
  Paper feeds. Toner settles. The room stays quiet.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_PRINT_N2
  The memo slides into the tray: AUTHORIZED CLOSURE PATH — SIGNATURE LINE PRESENT.
  There is space for your name, and plenty of space for future interpretations.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_PRINT_N3
  You sign.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_CLOSURE_MEMO / N_END_MEMO_DRAFTED
  ITEM ACQUIRED: Authorized Closure Path Memo.
  The printer stops. The room doesn’t react.
  Nothing resolves yet. It just becomes official.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_START
  SPINDLE Chamber Floor. The containment sphere fills the center of the room like an oversized insulator—until it doesn’t.
  A status indicator cluster ticks through load, interlocks, and an authority field you didn’t enter.
  The interface scan panel waits with the patience of a copier.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_PANEL_BANNER
  On the interface scan panel: a notice banner, formatted like a utility bill that learned to threaten people.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEGAL_CONNECT
  A second line clicks in—too clean for this building.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_PRINT_NOTICE
  The printer in the wall stutters awake like it resents being included.
  A banner prints with the notice header and the reference string, crisp enough to be weaponized.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LOOK_SPHERE
  The sphere’s surface is mostly matte—until a thin band goes smooth and reflective, catching angles the room doesn’t offer.
  It doesn’t brighten. It clarifies.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LOOK_INDICATORS
  Indicators: ROTATION FRAMES — SYNCH TIGHT.
  INTERLOCKS — ARMED.
  AUTHORITY — NON-LOCAL.
  A small light labeled RETIREMENT CHECKLIST blinks like it’s asking permission.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_LEAVE_OBS
  You step toward the stairs. The chamber doesn’t follow you.
  The panel continues to wait, as if you only paused a sentence.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_SHUTDOWN_INTRO
  The interface scan panel offers the official shutdown sequence: staged steps, each with a place for a reason phrase and a signature block you can’t sign digitally.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_NARRATOR_HAND_HOVER
  Your hand hovers near the button. It is large enough to be a confession.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_NARRATOR_ROUTES_COLLAPSE
  You confirm. The panel accepts it the way a form accepts ink: without agreement, with permanence.
  The status indicator cluster steps down in clean increments.
  Routes collapse—not dramatically, just decisively—like doors closing in adjacent rooms you can’t see.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_START
  Control Room. The main console sits in an administrative state: a compliance hold banner, a draft memo queued, and a blinking field that wants a reason phrase more than it wants the truth.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_LEAVE_N
  You step back. The room keeps humming like it has a union contract.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ASKAUTH_N
  The console opens AUTHORITY CHAIN: “Add signatory / add attachment / echo-back text.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_SUBMIT_N
  On the console: “SUBMIT REQUEST — RELATIONSHIP/CLASS UPDATE (NON-LOCAL).” Fields: SUBJECT NODE, REQUESTED CATEGORY, REASON PHRASE, AUTHORITY CHAIN, ATTACHMENTS.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_REF_N
  The printer chatters. A header sheet slides into the tray.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_CATL_N
  You select the category that pretends the past was competent enough to have meant this. Legacy codes scroll like they’ve been waiting.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_CATT_N
  You choose the narrowest existing label. It feels like a lie engineered for survivability.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ADDLEGAL_N
  You tap OLEA Legal’s recorded line into the chain. The console prepares an echo-back statement for spoken acknowledgment.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ADDLEGAL_CONSOLE
  On-screen echo-back: “OLEA Legal acknowledges submission for category update as retirement processing instrument; accepts limited-purpose licensed relationship classification for SOL‑EARTH‑LOCAL; no admission of novelty; continuous logging maintained; operator present on-site.”
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_PROCESS_N
  The console displays: “PROCESSING WINDOW ACTIVE.” The printer starts again, like it wants witnesses.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_START
  Control Room.
  The air smells like warmed plastic and old coffee that never quite evaporated.
  The main console displays three “NORMAL” indicators that do not share a definition.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_START_2
  In the log printer tray: a fresh stack of fanfold paper. The top page is still curling like it remembers heat.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_START_3
  The console is labeled in five different fonts.
  A strip of tape beneath the screen reads: “DON’T ADJECTIVIZE THE INCIDENT.”
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_ASK_LOGS
  No one answers. The printer clicks once, as if clearing its throat, and then stays silent.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_BINDER_INTRO
  The binder is swollen with addenda.
  A tab reads: “UNEXPECTED REFLECTIVE BEHAVIOR — WORDING GUIDANCE,” underlined twice.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_THRESHOLDS_INTRO
  Threshold settings display in tolerances and acronyms.
  A tiny note in the corner reads: “WIDENING ≠ HIDING,” like someone got defensive in advance.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_ATTACH_MEMO
  A text field opens. It feels accusatory.
  You attach the closure-path memo.
  The console accepts it without enthusiasm, like it’s seen better lies.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_WIDEN_APPLIED
  The advisory line on the trend graph stays where it is.
  Only the meaning of the line changes.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_RAISE_TRIP_2
  You enter a new value. The red line moves. The machine does not.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_ROUTING_INTRO
  Alarm routing is a map of who gets blamed first.
  Most destinations are crossed out and replaced with handwritten initials.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_RECLASSIFY_LEGACY_2
  The alarm panel on the wall remains calm.
  Calm is a routing choice.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_ROUTE_MAINT
  You select a destination queue titled “MAINT — WEEKLY.”
  It has the soothing energy of a drawer.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_ROUTE_MAINT_3
  You sign as closure authority.
  The console accepts your credential.
  It does not thank you.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_INTERLOCKS_INTRO
  Interlocks read like a compromise between physics and office politics.
  A sticky note on the bezel says: “AUTO-ANYTHING IS HOW WE GOT REPORTS.”
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_DISABLE_AUTO_2
  AUTO-ENABLE flips to OFF.
  The room does not feel safer. It feels documented.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_TWOSTEP_REFERENCE
  You reference the binder section: “Unexpected Reflective Behavior — Wording Guidance.”
  The console links the gate to a document that insists nothing is happening.
  It’s a neat trick: you can only do the thing by affirming it’s not a thing.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_TWOSTEP_GENERIC
  The console accepts “GENERIC SAFETY HOLD.”
  Generic is harder to defend later, but easier to sell now.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_REPORTING_INTRO
  A dropdown labeled “EVENT VOCABULARY.”
  It’s the most dangerous control on the screen.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_SET_MEAS_ARTIFACT_2
  The words settle into place, ready to outlive you.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_PRINT_INTRO
  The print queue shows pending reports with timestamps clustered too neatly.
  Someone likes clean intervals. Or fears them.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_PRINT_CONFIG_REPORT_2
  The page lands in the tray like a receipt for a decision.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_PRINT_TREND
  The printer produces a graph with a line that never crosses anything, because you moved the anything.
- SCN-073 / DG_SCN_073_HIDE_ALIGNMENT / N_EXECUTE_RESULT
  The screen refreshes. “NORMAL” remains “NORMAL.”
  The alignment trace continues its quiet behavior inside the newly acceptable band.
  In the printer tray, a final page feeds out and stops halfway, like it’s listening.
  The room stays calm.
  On paper, it always has.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_START
  Records Hallway. Beige paint that gave up decades ago.
  A metal door labeled RECORDS. A pneumatic tube station with a cracked acrylic lid.
  A fire panel note taped like an apology. A fax placard with numbers that look corrected by committee.
  Your drafted memo sits in your hand like it’s already tired of you.
  
  You can either make this exist on paper, or make it exist fast.
  Both have afterlives.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_FIRE_NOTE
  A laminated note under the fire panel: “DO NOT RESET WITHOUT INCIDENT NUMBER.”
  Someone has underlined INCIDENT and written “(which one?)” in pencil.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_PLACARD
  A placard with a posted fax number for “RETIREMENT PROCESSING — OLEA.”
  Under it, a smaller sticker: “NON-LOCAL COMPLIANCE NOTICES: DO NOT DISCUSS VERBALLY.”
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_VM_03
  The voicemail ends like a door latch.
  The exclusions are weirdly reusable.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_BUZZ
  A buzzer you’re not supposed to call a buzzer. You press it anyway.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_REC_COMMIT_TUBE_02
  You initial where the Clerk taps. The staples stay exactly where they are.
  The packet goes into a tube capsule that smells like rubber and old air.
  
  The capsule clicks shut. The station inhales it.
  The hallway is quiet in the way paperwork likes.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_TUBE_INTRO
  The tube station has a slot, a destination dial, and a warning label that has been re-laminated over itself.
  A small placard reads: “TUBE IS NOT A RECORD. TUBE IS A TRANSPORT.”
  Someone has added: “TRANSPORT BECOMES RECORD IF IT GOES MISSING.”
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_TUBE_DEST_RP
  The dial stops on a code that looks like it was designed to be misread.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_TUBE_SEND_01
  You seal the capsule. Your thumb hesitates on the latch like it wants a witness.
  
  The station takes the capsule with a hard pull.
  No receipt prints. The tube doesn’t do reassurance.
- SCN-074 / DG_LIABILITY_REDIRECT_SCN074 / N_TUBE_DEST_REC
  The destination clicks to RECORDS INTAKE, as if the building is trying to keep the story local.
