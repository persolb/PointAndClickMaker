# OPS_OPERATOR

- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_OPS_WARN
  That’s a demand event. It is not an alarm-alarm. It’s a request with consequences.
  And before you say anything: don’t say “emergency.” The word “emergency” drags in different people.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_OPS_COACH
  Confirm what, specifically.
  Say you “acknowledge the demand event” and you’re “initiating a load-shed response.” It matters because the transcript outlives us.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_ACK_OPS
  They always say “maintain stability” like it’s a separate switch.
  Answer it. Then we generate the ID off the printer header. If you freestyle an ID, auditors treat it like fiction.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_AUTH_OPS
  Good. Standard language, no new nouns.
  Now we move loads—after we have paper.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_MAINTAIN_OPS
  “Assume it is” is my favorite engineering instruction.
  Print the banner. Staple it. Then we move loads. In that order.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_DEFINE_OPS
  See? It’s a feelings category with numbers attached.
  We can comply. We just have to choose what we call “noncritical.”
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_TARGET_OPS
  “Auto-recovers” is a trap category.
  We shed clean if we redefine what counts as essential to verification. The checklist will complain. Let it.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_COMMIT_DIRECT_OPS
  That’s fair, unfortunately.
  Use the printer. The tray is not optional. The tray is our alibi.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_DETAILS_OPS
  “Auto-recovers” is a trap category.
  We can shed clean if we redefine what counts as essential to verification. Which is going to irritate the checklist.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_DETAILS_ACK_OPS
  That’s fair, unfortunately.
  Use the printer. The tray is not optional. The tray is our alibi.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_STAGED_OPS
  Staged is fine. It also means more timestamps.
  Print first. Then we touch hardware.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_NOTICE_OPS
  They said “directive.” That’s their comfort word.
  Say yes. Then print. Then we touch hardware.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_BARGAIN_OPS
  Don’t fight their delivery method. Fight their ambiguity.
  Get the number on paper and then comply loudly.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_PRINT_OPS
  Thank you. Staple that to the verification packet.
  Not because it helps. Because it proves you weren’t improvising alone.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_READBACK_OPS
  Now we can do the dangerous part with a warm feeling in our pocket.
  Go to the console when you’re ready.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_PRINT_ACK_OPS
  Answer stability. Then we move.
  If you already have the header serial, use it. Attributable beats elegant.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_REVIEW_OPS
  You can read that all day and it will not become kinder.
  We comply, and we annotate. That’s the whole job.
- SCN-042 / DG_SCN_042_ALARM_PANEL / N_STEP_AWAY_OPS
  You can walk away from the panel. You can’t walk away from the timestamp.
  When you’re ready, we answer the nice person on the speaker and we become a record.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_OPS_COACH
  Don’t say “emergency.” Don’t say “we’ll try.”
  Say: you acknowledge the demand event, you are initiating response, stability maintained per interlocks. It’s ugly. It survives transcripts.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_AUTH_OPS
  Good. Standard language, no new nouns. Now we make the console do something attributable.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_THREAT_PASS_OPS
  That works because it’s still a request for clarity, not a new fight. Now comply loudly and print something we can staple.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_THREAT_FAIL_OPS
  They’re right about the recording. You’re right about attribution.
  Print the header. Then act. Don’t burn time on tone.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_MAP_OPS
  That label is doing emotional work. The checklist treats VERIFICATION SUPPORT as untouchable because it wants a stable baseline.
  The grid treats it as discretionary because it’s not a hospital. Both are correct in their own court.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_MAP_ASK_OPS
  You can shed some without touching it. Not twelve megawatts.
  To hit the target cleanly, you either redefine support, or you shed something that will auto-recover and Dispatch will call it noncompliance.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_DEFINE_OPS
  Hear that? “Undocumented.” That’s the real interlock.
  The console can do staged shed with timestamps. Or single-step. The cleanest path to “no chatter” is the macro the checklist hates.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_CONFIG_OPS
  Staged gives you more timestamps. More timestamps means more places to hide competence.
  Single-step is cleaner electrically. Also cleaner for blame.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_STAGED_OPS
  There it is. The box that decides whether you’re “following procedure” or “making decisions.”
  Don’t invent a new category. Reclass with an existing code.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_STAGED_CONFIRM_OPS
  Good. Now make the reclass legitimate, or this becomes “cycling in disguise.”
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_RECLASS_OPS
  Pick the code that already exists. Don’t invent a new justification. New justifications become meetings.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_RECLASS_DONE_OPS
  Good. Now it’s not a deviation. It’s a classification update. Words matter because they’re what survives.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_SINGLESTEP_OPS
  That’s the one. It keeps interlocks happy by nudging the rotation frames into a tighter relationship.
  The checklist will call it “baseline alteration.” Dispatch will call it “stable.” You will call it “documented.”
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_ALIGNNAME_OPS
  Because someone once tried to describe what the control law does, and then Legal made them put it back in the drawer.
  Operationally: it balances load without chatter by coordinating the frames. That’s all we need to say out loud.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_POST_ACK_OPS
  Say it clean. Then we watch the numbers.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_ARMED_OPS
  “Armed” is a terrible word. It implies intent.
  We did not give it intent. We gave it permission.
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_PRINT_OPS
  Thank you. That’s attributable. That’s the difference between “you did it” and “the room did it.”
- SCN-043 / DG_SCN_043_MAIN_CONSOLE / N_STEP_AWAY_OPS
  You can walk away from the screen. You can’t walk away from the timestamp.
  When you’re ready, come back and do it in a way that can be stapled.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SPHERE_OPS_WARN
  Before you name it—
  Don’t call it a “mirror.” Don’t call it “responsive.”
  “Reflective behavior” is the phrase in the legacy report. It’s not better. It’s just already filed.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SPHERE_HELD_OPS
  “Held” is a compliance word, not an operations word.
  Operations has “stable,” “armed,” “inhibit,” and “operator error.”
  Compliance has “held,” because “held” implies someone is responsible for holding it.
  Which—just for my peace of mind—is not me.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SPHERE_SAFE_OPS
  Safe is a category that triggers people.
  So: there is no proximity interlock violation on my panel.
  If the surface goes fully reflective and stays there, you step back and you say “visual condition change.”
  Not “something happened.” Not “it looked at me.” You’d be surprised what becomes testimony.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SPHERE_LOG_OPS
  Good. Add time, location, and that you remained outside the barrier stripe.
  “I didn’t cross the line” is the kind of sentence that keeps you employed.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_STATUS_OPS_CORRECT
  It’s not new. It’s newly visible.
  “New” implies the system changed.
  This implies we noticed.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_STATUS_WHO_OPS
  There isn’t a “who” field on my screen.
  There’s an “authority” field and a blank space where my weekend used to be.
  If it’s what I think it is, you’re going to want the notice number before you do anything brave.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_STATUS_CLEAR_OPS
  You can clear alarms locally. You can’t clear holds locally.
  Holds are how remote offices say “don’t make this my fault” without using those words.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_SCAN_OPS_COACH
  Use it like a document scanner.
  Not like a conversation.
  If you make it a conversation, you’ve created a stakeholder.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_REF_EXPAND_OPS
  Read it back out loud. Then print it.
  I want the room to know you didn’t invent the number.
  That’s how we survive “later.”
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_STANDING_OPS_EXPLAIN
  In local operations, standing means “badge works.”
  In non-local compliance, standing means “eligible to be processed.”
  Which is a phrase I hate, because it treats people like forms.
  But it’s their phrase, and their phrases are sticky.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PRINT_NOTICE_OPS
  Good. Keep that.
  Don’t summarize it from memory. Attach the original. Let the machine accuse itself.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PULL_LAST_OPS
  That’s the correct emotional response.
  Now make it attributable: print it, annotate it, and attach it to whatever closure packet you still think you’re finishing.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PRESENCE_OPS
  Good—keep it boring.
  “On-site” is a physical claim. Physical claims are defensible.
  Don’t add motives. Don’t add theories. Just existence.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_PRINT_CONFIRM_OPS
  Staple it to the front.
  Not because it fixes anything. Because it proves you were present when it didn’t.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_ESTOP_OPS_WARN
  You can press it. You can.
  But pressing it is a declaration. Declarations summon committees.
  If you touch it, I need a reason phrase and a time stamp. Not a feeling.
- SCN-062 / DG_SCN_062_HUB13_ACT3 / N_ESTOP_EXPLAIN_OPS
  It stops local motion control and trips local breakers.
  It does not stop non-local holds. It does not stop paperwork.
  It mostly stops you from claiming you were following the planned sequence.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SPHERE_OPS_WARN
  Before you name it—don’t.
  “Reflective behavior” is the phrase in the legacy report.
  It’s not better. It’s just already filed.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SPHERE_HOW_OFTEN_OPS
  It’s intermittent. Which is a word I like because it doesn’t imply intent.
  We do not say “it’s trying.” We say “condition observed.”
  Same result, less blame.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SPHERE_LOG_OPS
  Good. Add time. Add distance. Add that you stayed outside the barrier stripe.
  “I did not cross the line” is the kind of sentence that keeps your badge working.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_STATUS_OPS_CORRECT
  It’s not new. It’s newly visible.
  “New” implies the system changed. This implies we noticed.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_STATUS_CLEAR_OPS
  You can clear alarms locally. You cannot clear holds locally.
  Holds are how remote offices say “don’t make this my fault” without using those words.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_STATUS_WHO_OPS
  There isn’t a who field on my screen.
  There’s an authority field and a blank space where my weekend used to be.
  If you’re doing anything today, you want it to end in a reference number.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ESTOP_OPS_WARN
  You can press it. You can.
  But pressing it is a declaration. Declarations summon committees.
  If you touch it, I need a reason phrase and a time stamp. Not a feeling.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ESTOP_WHAT_OPS
  It stops local motion control and trips local breakers.
  It does not stop non-local holds. It does not stop paperwork.
  Mostly it stops you from claiming you followed the planned sequence.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SCAN_OPS_COACH
  Use it like a document scanner. Not like a conversation.
  If you make it a conversation, you’ve created a stakeholder.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_ATTACH_REF_OPS
  Print that screen when you’re done.
  Not because it’s meaningful. Because it proves the machine agreed you typed what you typed.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SIGNATORY_OPS
  Good—keep it boring.
  “On-site” is a physical claim. Physical claims are defensible.
  Don’t add motives. Don’t add theories. Just existence.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_LOAD_TEMPLATE_OPS
  Don’t explain.
  Explanations invite questions. Questions invite ownership.
- SCN-067 / DG_SCN_067_SUBMIT_VARIANCE_ACK / N_SUBMIT_WITH_NOTE_OPS
  Fine. One sentence is still a form.
  Two sentences becomes a story. Stories get assigned authors.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_RULES
  Before you touch anything—keep your language clean.
  No “emergency.” No “it’s trying.” No “still.”
  Print headers. Then act. In that order. I’m not being precious. I’m being employable.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_STATUS
  Local motion control: permissive.
  Proximity: no interlock violation.
  Non-local: there’s a hold. Which is not my category.
  And logs are live. Don’t make me chase your timestamps.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_ATTRIBUTION_PUSH
  You can’t clear it locally, but you can comply loudly.
  Get the reference number off that panel. Read it back. Then print it. I want attribution.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_REF_INSTRUCTIONS
  Good. Don’t summarize it from memory. Attach the original. Let the machine accuse itself.
  Print it. Tray, not screenshot. Screenshots become opinions.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_PERSONALITY_NOTE
  They heard you. They did not accept you. That’s their whole personality.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_DEFENSIBLE
  Make the next action look like it was always the next action.
  Use the official sequence. Keep logging on. Print before and after.
  If you hit the big red button, you’ve declared a story. Stories get authors.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_HOLD_REALITY
  We don’t clear holds. We document around them until someone upstream gets bored.
  Or until you collapse routes so hard the hold becomes… academic.
  I didn’t say that. The printer did.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_ATTRIBUTABLE_THANKS
  Thank you. That’s attributable.
  Print that screen when it echoes back. Not because it matters. Because later, someone will pretend it did.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_STAPLE_IT
  Staple it to the front.
  Not because it fixes anything. Because it proves you were present when it didn’t.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_VISUAL_CHANGE
  Visual condition change. Time and distance.
  And—say it out loud—confirm you stayed outside the barrier stripe.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_BADGE_LINE
  Good. That sentence keeps your badge working.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_ARMED_WORD
  “Armed” is a terrible word. It implies intent.
  But it’s the label we inherited, so it’s the label we get judged by.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_TIMESTAMP_WARNING
  You can walk away from the panel. You can’t walk away from the timestamp.
  Come back when you’re ready to be a record.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_DONT_CALL_IT
  Don’t call it that in the log.
  Call it: “Local motion control trip.” Reason phrase. Time stamp.
  Because right now you’re not stopping a machine. You’re starting a meeting.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_READ_ONCE_MORE
  Read the reason phrase one more time.
  Then do it. And don’t improvise halfway through because you got bored.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_NO_IMPROV
  Do it in the order the console expects.
  If it wants a reason phrase, give it a reason phrase. If it wants a time stamp, give it a time stamp.
- SCN-074 / SCN_074_TERMINAL_SHUTDOWN / N_OPS_PRINT_POSTSTATE
  There. That’s the sound of fewer options.
  Print the post-state. Staple it.
  And stay where you are. Presence is part of the record.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_OPS0
  Logs are live. Printer has paper. Tray is empty, which I’m mentioning because later someone will pretend it matters.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_LEAVE_O
  You can walk away from the panel. You can’t walk away from the timestamp. Come back when you’re ready to be a record.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ASKAUTH_O
  And whatever you type, print before and after. Screenshots become opinions. Paper becomes alibis.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_REF_O
  Print that. Tray. Not a photo. Not a transcription. The machine gets to accuse itself.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_ADDLEGAL_O
  Print that echo-back screen when it posts. Not because it’s sacred. Because later someone will pretend you paraphrased.
- SCN-074 / DG_SCN074_RENEGOTIATION / N_PROCESS_O
  Staple it. Front of the packet. Not because it fixes anything. Because it proves the universe agreed, briefly, to be filed.
