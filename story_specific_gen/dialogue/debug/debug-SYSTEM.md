- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_FORM
  (Printer, on paper)
  BASELINE LOGGING — INITIALIZATION REQUEST
  Reason: Procedural continuity.
  Operator: ____________________  (print block)
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_LOOK2
  (Printer, on paper)
  Definition: “BASELINE” denotes readings obtained during non-excursive operation.
  Note: “Excursive” is a reporting term and does not describe motion.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_LOOK_ASK1
  (Console prompt)
  Comparable state: Prior baseline logs.
  If no prior baseline logs exist, initiate baseline logs.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_EXCURSIVE1
  (Console prompt)
  Term owner: Compliance Language Library v3.2.
  Maintained by: External parties.
  Clarification: Ownership does not imply responsibility.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_ASK1
  (Console prompt)
  Baseline is the condition in which readings are legally comparable.
  “Comparable” does not mean “similar.”
  Similarity is interpretive.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_ASK3
  (Console prompt)
  It is not “running.”
  It is in continuous operation.
  “Running” implies discretion.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_WITNESS_LOCKED2
  (UI)
  LOCKED: Witness authority not present / not recognized.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_WITNESS_PASS
  (Console prompt)
  Witness authority: recognized.
  Witness sign-off: available.
  Reminder: Witnessing is not endorsement.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_COMMIT2
  (Console prompt)
  Baseline logging: INITIATE.
  Operator acknowledgement required.
  Reminder: Acknowledgement is not admission.
- SCN-037 / DG_BASELINE_LOG_PRINTER_TRAY / N_COMMIT5
  (Printer, on paper)
  TIME-STAMP (LOCAL): 07:18:44
  MODE: Continuous Operation (Baseline)
  NOTES: Readings valid for internal comparability only.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_START_03
  Alignment sequence: initiated.
  Reflective behavior: documented.
  Witness presence: confirmed.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_START_04
  Routing is available.
  Proceed to overflow intake.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_STEPBACK_02
  Routing remains available.
  Witness presence remains confirmed.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_ATTACHED_SYS_01
  Attached mass is mass that remains associated with the witness during surface address.
  This is not an allegation of adhesion. It is a tracking term.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_ATTACHED_SYS_02
  You are the witness.
  Your tools, apparel, and personal effects are included unless explicitly declaimed.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_DECLAIM_SYS_01
  Declaiming requires a signed exclusion list and a physical placement boundary.
  The placement boundary must be marked with tape of an approved color.
  The approved color is listed in Appendix D, which is currently unavailable on this terminal.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_DECLAIM_SYS_02
  For clarity: proceeding without declaiming is acceptable.
  It is also, statistically, what most witnesses do.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_APPENDIXD_SYS_01
  Appendix D was migrated to the non-local compliance library.
  Access requires a network token.
  This facility does not maintain tokens, as a cost-saving measure.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_APPENDIXD_SYS_02
  This is not a defect.
  It is an accounting outcome.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_ASSOC_SYS_01
  You have been observed in proximity during reflective behavior documentation.
  Association is established by witness requirement, not by preference.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_ASSOC_SYS_02
  If it helps: the association ends when routing completes.
  Or when the witness ceases to be present.
  We do not recommend the second method.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_RECOMMEND_SYS_01
  Based on historical recordkeeping.
  Missing witnesses create reconciliation gaps.
  Reconciliation gaps become interviews.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_RECOMMEND_SYS_02
  Interviews are not a hazard.
  They are, however, prolonged.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_OVERFLOW_SYS_01
  Overflow intake is an administrative capacity.
  When primary handling is saturated, intake receives and sorts.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_OVERFLOW_SYS_02
  This is routine load management.
  The fact that you can see it is incidental.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_PRIMARY_SYS_01
  Primary handling is not on-site.
  On-site language will not assist you.
  Please select a local action.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_PRIMARY_SYS_02
  Available local actions: proceed, abort, or request a routing summary.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SATURATED_SYS_01
  With routed items pending disposition.
  Disposition categories include: accepted, rejected, held, and misfiled.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SATURATED_SYS_02
  Misfiled is a temporary status.
  Temporary statuses can be… persistent.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_STATUS_SYS_01
  Please do not introduce new terms during routing.
  New terms require review.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_REVIEW_SYS_01
  By the assurance function.
  The assurance function is external.
  External functions prefer comparability.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_REVIEW_SYS_02
  If you require a comparable event, the closest match is:
  “unexpected reflective behavior.”
  Which is not a reflection. Legally.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SHUTDOWN_SYS_01
  Request logged: terminology preference.
  Classification remains: routing.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SHUTDOWN_SYS_02
  For avoidance of doubt: “shutdown verification” implies a shutdown exists to verify.
  No shutdown is currently in effect.
  Therefore verification would be speculative.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SHUTDOWN_SYS_03
  Speculation is discouraged in witness-facing prompts.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SCAN_SYS_01
  Routing summary available.
  This summary is for awareness only and does not constitute instruction.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SCAN_SYS_02
  Step 1: Confirm witness presence. (Complete.)
  Step 2: Confirm reflective behavior documentation. (Complete.)
  Step 3: Route attached mass to overflow intake. (Pending.)
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_SCAN_SYS_03
  Note: If you feel discomfort, please record it after routing to maintain sequence integrity.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_RECORD_SYS_01
  In the post-routing acknowledgment.
  Acknowledgment is mandatory.
  Emotional content is optional but appreciated for completeness.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_ESTOP_SYS_01
  Emergency stop will initiate an interruption record.
  Interruption records require a stated reason.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_ESTOP_SYS_02
  Acceptable stated reasons include: fire, structural movement, and unauthorized terminology.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_UNAUTHORIZED_SYS_01
  Terms not present in the facility’s approved vocabulary list.
  The vocabulary list is maintained off-site.
  Off-site maintenance is more reliable, per policy.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_UNAUTHORIZED_SYS_02
  If you press the button without a reason, a reason will be assigned.
  Assigned reasons are frequently unflattering.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_PROCEED_SYS_01
  Proceeding.
  Please remain calm for record consistency.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_PROCEED_SYS_02
  Reminder: Do not describe this as travel in any subsequent reporting.
  The approved term is: routing.
- SCN-044 / DG_SPNDLE_ROUTING / N_PROCEED_SYS_03
  Routing attached mass to overflow intake.
  Sequence integrity: maintained.
