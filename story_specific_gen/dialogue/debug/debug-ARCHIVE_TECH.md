# ARCHIVE_TECH

- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_OPENING
  If you’re here to browse, you’re not.
  If you’re here to retrieve, state the proper heading.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_FAST_RESULTS
  That was fast.
  Fast results are the ones that get misfiled.
  Not by me. By… people.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_PROPER_HEADING
  “Endpoint Interconnections — Legacy.”
  Subheading: “Continuity Exceptions.”
  Do not say “incident,” do not say “anomaly.” Those are interpretive categories.
  We file facts. Even when the facts behave.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_DEFINE_CONTINUITY
  A continuity exception is a catalog constraint tag.
  It marks a record that survives scheme changes without becoming a different record.
  It’s not a story. It’s a filing survival trait.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_NO_CITATION_NO_NAMES
  Names require citation.
  Citation requires a document that already names it.
  If it isn’t named in-record, I won’t invent a name by request.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_WHY_NOT_HEADING
  “Why” is not a heading.
  “Lineage” is a constraint tag. It indicates you are attached to a continuity chain.
  Which means the archive believes you belong to a system that predates your request to exist in it.
  That’s not personal. That’s formatting.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_GIVE_HEADING_PRAISE
  “Endpoint Interconnections — Legacy.”
  Subheading: “Continuity Exceptions.”
  You’re doing better. That sounded like a person who won’t make me write a correction memo.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_STATE_HEADING_REQUIRED
  State the heading.
  Not because I’m difficult—because the system logs your phrasing, and then it becomes true in a way you can’t appeal.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_UPSTREAM_EXPLAIN
  That is not a question. That is a solicitation for narrative.
  “Upstream/external” is a relationship flag. It indicates directionality of authority without naming it.
  Names require citation. Citation requires a document that already names it.
  This is how we stay consistent.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_CIRCLE
  If you had a citation, you wouldn’t be asking me for one.
  That’s not a reprimand. It’s a circle.
  We live in circles.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_GIVE_HEADING_PROCEED
  “Endpoint Interconnections — Legacy.”
  “Continuity Exceptions.”
  Proceed.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_OLEA_ACCEPT
  That is… appropriately framed.
  You’re requesting continuity context for safe closure activities, not attribution.
  Attribution breeds correspondence. Correspondence breeds time.
  
  Proper heading: “Endpoint Interconnections — Legacy / Continuity Exceptions.”
  I will initiate retrieval services. I am not endorsing your conclusions. I do not have conclusions.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_PLACEMENT_NOT_MEANING
  Before you type: this retrieval does not certify meaning.
  It certifies placement. That distinction keeps my job uncomplicated.
- SCN-054 / DG_LEGACY_ARCHIVE / TECH_DONT_REMOVE_ORIGINALS
  Don’t remove originals.
  People do, and then they become originals. It’s a whole problem.
