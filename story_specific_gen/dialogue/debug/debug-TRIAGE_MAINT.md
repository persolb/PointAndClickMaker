# TRIAGE_MAINT

- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_INTRO
  You’re looking at it like it owes you something.
  It doesn’t. The registry only acknowledges three things: a sponsor, a scope, and an acceptable failure mode.
  Anything else is— (stops) —a story.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_EXPLAIN_AMR
  Attached Mass Registry. It’s how we pretend a thing is a thing without admitting we discovered a new category of thing.
  “Attached” means it stays attached to an existing endpoint record.
  “Mass” means we’re not arguing about whether it’s a person, a tool, or a— (catches self) —a compliance event.
  “Registry” means it becomes someone else’s problem later, which is the only sustainable model.
  Pick one: scope, sponsor, failure mode.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_EXPLAIN_SPONSOR
  Me sponsoring means I accept it is maintenance-class, not research-class, not incident-class, and definitely not “novel.”
  I can sponsor within scope. I do not sponsor mystery.
  Give me a sentence I can sign that doesn’t turn into a hearing.
  Pick: show me the endpoint, or tell me the failure mode.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_READ_METADATA
  Let me see.
  (reads, lips moving) Mm. Legacy metadata helps, because it implies the endpoint already exists on paper.
  Paper is the closest thing we have to reality in this building.
  But metadata doesn’t tell me what you want the AMR to say.
  It needs an acceptable failure mode. Something boring. Something that won’t evolve.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_EXPLAIN_FAILURE
  “Acceptable” means I can warranty the intervention. Not the universe.
  Examples: misclassification of endpoint, routing error, degraded seal geometry, sensor inversion, reflective behavior—
  Which is not a reflection. Legally. Because “reflection” implies the surface is behaving as designed.
  You tell me which one you can live with in writing.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_THREAT_RESP
  Sure. Log “open anomaly.” Put “unknown” in a field and watch it reproduce.
  Then we get an assurance liaison asking what framework it’s comparable to, and you’ll be here next week with a binder and a headache.
  I’m offering you a boring path. Take it, or don’t.
  Pick: scope, sponsor, failure mode.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_PERSUADE_PASS
  I don’t care if you’re closing the moon by end of quarter.
  OLEA closure packets are a bonfire of other people’s signatures. I’m not adding mine unless the sentence is tight.
  I can issue an AMR tag and a tool that does one thing and can’t be mistaken for permission.
  But you’re going to pick a framing that keeps this inside Interconnection Maintenance.
  Choose your failure mode. Then we do it.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_PERSUADE_FAIL
  Deadline isn’t a failure mode.
  If you want my signature, you give me scope language I can stand behind. Otherwise, you’re just trying to outsource consequences.
  Pick: scope, sponsor, failure mode.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_SCOPE_OPTIONS
  Scope is what the tag allows you to touch without it becoming “tampering.”
  We do: identify, attach, seal, and document.
  We do not: test, probe, explore, or— (flat) —go.
  If you need tools, you get a tool that implies a seal, not a theory.
  Now. What are we calling the problem?
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_BARGAIN_RESP
  Fine. You keep it maintenance-class in your reports, you don’t improvise with my tag, and you don’t describe outcomes with… adventurous verbs.
  In exchange, you get: AMR entry, physical tag, printout, and one tool with one job.
  Pick the sentence. I’m not picking it for you.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_ROUTING_OK
  Routing error is safe. Everyone hates it, which is how you know it’s real.
  It says: the network did what it does, and the paperwork didn’t keep up.
  I can sponsor that, with one addition: “No personnel transfer implied.”
  Don’t react. I add that to keep other people from adding worse things later.
  If you agree, we issue.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_MISCLASS_OK
  Misclassification is… workable.
  It admits the endpoint exists, but the label is wrong. That’s upstream’s shame, not mine.
  I’m adding: “Corrective maintenance limited to seal and registry attachment.”
  You do anything beyond that, you didn’t get it from me.
  If you agree, we issue.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_REFLECT_OK
  We can use the legacy phrase because it already survived one legal cycle.
  But I’m not writing “reflection.” I’m writing “reflective behavior,” and then I’m writing “non-reflection.”
  Yes, it’s stupid. It’s also defensible.
  If you agree to scope-limited intervention, we issue.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_HANDOVER_1
  Okay. AMR is created and attached to the endpoint record.
  Here’s your tag. Don’t lose it; replacement implies duplication, and duplication implies a population.
  Here’s the printout. Keep it dry. Paper is allergic to accountability.
  And— (rummages, irritated) —this.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_TOOL_SCOPE
  Scope-limited seal punch.
  It makes one mark, at one depth, on approved material.
  It cannot “open” anything. It cannot “test” anything. It cannot be used as evidence of permission.
  If someone asks, you didn’t get a tool. You got a warranty boundary.
- SCN-055 / AMR_TRIAGE_READER / TRIAGE_SIGNOFF
  That’s your paperwork. That’s your scope.
  Don’t make me learn new nouns about this place.
