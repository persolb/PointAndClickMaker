- SCN-047 / SCN_047_INTAKE_HALL / N_WIN7_2
  Property is for claims.
  Claims require a claimant, in the normal sense.
  Intake can create a fileable entity.
  Once you’re fileable, you can claim things and be disappointed like everyone else.

  I can issue a stub.

  A stub is not a token. A token is not a receipt. A receipt is not an entitlement.
  Intake handles the receipt part.
