# SECURITY_DISPATCH

- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_GREETING
  Okay—hi—one moment. I’m going to note you initiated contact, for the record.
  State your name, your organization, and whether you are attempting entry for work or for access.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_DIFF
  Yes. Not practically—procedurally.
  Work implies an assigned scope with a dispatch number. Access implies you are here to be on site.
  I don’t decide which you are. I just label the call so nobody later says I “authorized” something.
  Also: if you say access, it triggers the visitor script and I hate the visitor script.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_BADGE_A
  Copy. OLEA field systems. That’s… better than vendor, on paper.
  Hold the badge to the camera—slowly. The camera is temperamental, and if it fails it becomes an incident, which is a whole different folder.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_BADGE_C
  Got it. I’m logging verification attempted. Not verified.
  Because the camera doesn’t do attestations. It does images.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_OPEN_GATE
  I can request a cycle. I cannot open it.
  If I open it, I’m the last human decision in the chain, and then my name is in a deposition slideshow.
  Use the keypad. It prints a receipt. The receipt proves you didn’t slip in, which—again—becomes my problem.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_CYCLE_PASS
  Okay. I submitted a cycle request. That is me requesting, not authorizing.
  If the gate controller accepts it, you’ll hear a relay click. If it ignores it, that’s also a valid outcome, technically.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_CYCLE_FAIL
  No. If I put my hands on a cycle request without a matching dispatch entry, it auto-flags as discretionary.
  Discretionary is how you get invited to explain yourself to people with clipboards.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_LAYERED
  It’s not contradictory. It’s layered. There’s a difference.
  Site Closed is the status. Authorized Personnel is the exception. Visitor Check-in is… historical.
  Facilities won’t remove signs without a removal form. Compliance won’t approve removal without photos of the current state.
  So we preserve the current state.
  Which is: all signs remain. Forever. Like sediment.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_PHOTOS
  Not me. Respectfully.
  If you send them to me, I receive notice, and then I’m obligated to act, and then I can’t, and then I’m noncompliant.
  Send to your OLEA compliance mailbox, whatever it’s called this week. Attach the gate location.
  And—small thing—please don’t call it a hazard unless someone is actively bleeding. Hazard triggers alarms.
- SCN-001 / DG_SPINDLE_GATE_TUTORIAL / N_SECURITY_USE_KEYPAD
  Copy. Use the keypad and keep the receipt.
  The receipt is the only part of this process that doesn’t argue back later.
