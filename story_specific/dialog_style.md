## SUMMARY

Let NPCs talk like people protecting themselves mid-sentence. 
> “The incident was caused by unexpected reflective behavior.  
> Which is not a reflection.  
> Legally.”

Let NPCs react intensely to trivial issues and mildly to severe ones.

Do not make NPCs incompetent in their core skill.

Do not undercut the player’s competence.

### Procedural Text Rhythm
For every block of purely procedural text:
- insert one emotional tell
- or one self-protective clarification
- or one irrelevant fixation
Not all three. Just one.

### Shorten Player Responses, Lengthen NPC Responses

The player is concise + NPCs over-explain defensively

Player option:
> “Why is it still running?”

NPC response:
> “It is not still running.  
> It is running continuously.  
> ‘Still’ implies intent.”

## STRUCTURE
• Short exchanges.
• Escalation through repetition and reinterpretation.
• End scenes one beat early, before resolution.


## EXAMPLES
[NPC]
State rules confidently, even when they make no sense.

[PLAYER]
Ask practical questions that expose contradictions.
Respond with dry understatement, mild sarcasm, or polite confusion.

Offer help that creates a new, worse problem.

[PLAYER]
Accept the premise temporarily.
Test the rule in a literal way.
Point out the outcome without accusing the NPC of being wrong.

[NPC]
Take credit for the result, regardless of what happened.
Blame an unseen authority, outdated policy, or “how it’s always been.”
End statements decisively, as if the matter is settled.

Describe events plainly and without excitement.
Treat bizarre outcomes as routine, expected, and properly filed.
Clarify consequences, not motivations.
