### TASK

Rewrite **each main item** in `<dialogue>` so it sounds like a real person talking in the moment.

The result must feel:

* reactive, not explanatory
* situational, not essay-like
* defensive, clipped, and pragmatic
* shaped by liability and paperwork pressure, not pedagogy

---

### NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

* **Do not change meaning, intent, or story facts.**
* **Do not add new plot points, backstory, or world facts.**
* **Do not explain the story to the player.**
* **No coaching tone. No meta commentary.**
* **Keep the same number of items, in the same order (1:1 mapping).**
* **Preserve required tokens** (names, places, technical terms) unless clearly filler.
* Match the implied time period, region, and register.

---

### HARD STYLE CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

You MUST apply all of the following:

1. **Reduce explainer structure**

   * Avoid definition → implication → conclusion patterns.
   * Do not teach terminology unless the character must block an action.
   * Let implications remain implied.

2. **Ban binary contrast constructions**

   * Do NOT use:

     * “Not because X. Because Y.”
     * “That’s not A; that’s B.”
   * Motivation and distinctions must be indirect.

3. **Remove most definitional punchlines**

   * Avoid aphorisms, maxims, and tidy moral statements.
   * If humor exists, it should feel muttered, defensive, or situational.

4. **Collapse jargon into intelligible shorthand**

   * Replace heavy institutional language with how a real auditor abbreviates speech:

     * “the file,” “the log,” “paper,” “cover,” “that line,” “this bucket”
   * Keep it understandable, but less formal.

5. **Minimize “compliance voice”**

   * Fewer modal verbs and polished legal phrasing.
   * More interruptions, fragments, hedges, and cutoffs.
   * Occasional irritation or fatigue may surface.

6. **Avoid rhythmic repetition**

   * Do not reuse the same rhetorical shape across many lines.
   * Vary cadence, sentence length, and closure style.

7. **Prefer action pressure over explanation**

   * Show constraints by what the character refuses to log, say, or authorize.
   * Let silence, avoidance, or deflection do the work.

### WHAT TO FIX (COMMON MODEL TELLS)

Actively remove:

* Overly clean grammar sustained across multiple sentences
* Balanced parallelism and triads used as padding
* “Press release” neutrality
* Excessive legal or institutional polish
* Lines that sound quotable rather than spoken

---

### HOW TO REWRITE (PROCESS)

For each line:

1. Identify the **immediate purpose** (block, deflect, stall, log, warn).
2. Rewrite it as something said **because of what just happened**, not as a general principle.
3. Use:

   * contractions where natural
   * fragments where pressure would cut speech short
   * fewer explanations, more implication

4. Try to keep sentences short in order to fit on screen. Where needed, add a break where more dialogue will be shown after a key click, then the next dialogue after. For example:
"I wouldn’t call it dead.(pause)It’s waking up just enough to leave a mark."

If a line already sounds natural, change it minimally.

---

### FINAL CHECKS BEFORE OUTPUT

* Lines must sound speakable aloud, under mild stress.
* No lecturing, no definitions unless unavoidable.
* No repeated house style across dozens of lines.
* No meta language (“this shows,” “the point is,” etc.).
* No filler endings.
