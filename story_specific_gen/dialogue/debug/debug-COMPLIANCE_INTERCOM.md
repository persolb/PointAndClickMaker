# COMPLIANCE_INTERCOM

- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_INTRO_3
  Before you do anything with that panel—this is recorded for training and assurance purposes. Not yours. Ours.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_INTRO_4
  If you’re seeing “Not Current,” that means the system cannot confirm you are currently trained, which is different from you being untrained. It’s a documentation state. It’s not— it’s not an insult.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_INTRO_6
  Correct. Because LOTO is a behavior, and behavior requires currency. Not because you’re unsafe. Because we can’t prove you’re safe. There’s a difference that matters in a deposition.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_TALK_2
  I can walk you through acceptable methods. Acceptable as in “accepted by the interlock.” Not “endorsed by me personally,” just so we’re clean.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_ASK_WHAT_2
  A date. Not a metaphorical date. Not “I did the training in spirit.” A date the panel can parse.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_ASK_WHAT_3
  It will accept: a current training record via badge lookup, a stamped completion card, or a signed waiver with the correct wording. Correct wording meaning the wording Legal fought for, not the wording Safety prefers.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_ASK_WHAT_5
  Unavailable. Network segmentation. Which is— it’s deliberate. It’s not negligence. It’s containment. Different budget line.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_ASK_WHY_2
  Because the lock point is an interface, and interfaces are where people improvise. The date gate stops improvisation by forcing you to improvise in a documented manner.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_ASK_WHY_3
  Also, historically, someone bypassed a lock with a wrench and then claimed the lock was “confusing.” So now the lock is very clear. In the most inconvenient way possible.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_PERSUADE_2
  I hear you. And for the record, I respect the title. But this unit doesn’t have an “override,” it has an “acceptable alternate.” Language matters.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_PERSUADE_3
  If I tell you “go ahead,” and the panel still logs “Not Current,” then we’ve created a conflict between spoken instruction and hardware log. And hardware logs win. They always win. They don’t get nervous on the stand.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_PERSUADE_4
  So. Use the waiver if you have it. Or present a token the reader will accept. Those are your two clean paths— clean as in traceable.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_WAIVER_3
  Okay— yes. That’s the waiver format. And just to be explicit: a waiver is not “approval,” it’s “assumption of risk.” Which sounds like the same thing until someone gets ambitious.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_WAIVER_6
  Conditionally current. That’s good. That’s as good as it gets in this building.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_WAIVER_8
  Proceed. And— just— don’t make me say “good job” on a recording.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_3
  I need to state, for the record, that I did not instruct you to— I’m seeing what you’re doing. I’m not telling you to do it.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_4
  The panel is very literal. If it sees a date-shaped token, it will log a date-shaped compliance event. Which is… not fraud. It’s a substitution. Different words. Less prison.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_7
  Local current. Great. That means it will satisfy this interlock and annoy an auditor later, specifically one with time.
- SCN-032 / DG_TRAINING_INTERLOCK / N_STICKER_8
  If anyone asks: the system accepted an approved token. Do not say “sticker.” “Sticker” sounds like a craft.
