Create an image that is a sketch showing where each hotspot and navigation should be for this point-and-click game screen.

Each screen edge (left, right, top, bottom) may contain at most one exit. An exit is defined as a transition to one and only one adjacent screen. Multiple destinations may not share a single edge, path, or walkable corridor. If multiple narrative destinations exist, they must be distributed across distinct edges or be an onscreen hotspot (like a seperate door/road).

Don't list the same exit or hotspot twice.

Only make a line sketch so an artist has a guideline. No shading, colors, etc.
